  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 55 </p><h1>Developing Quick Thinking</h1>
  <p> The human mind is capable of lightning quick thinking (see "<a href="GM/E178.html">Exercise 178 - Time Distortion</a>"), but primarily when in a relaxed, positive frame of mind.</p>
  <p> Do you remember the last emotional outburst or argument that you had?</p>
  <p> Did you get too flustered for a proper comeback?</p>
  <p> Did you say to yourself later on, "I wish I had said (such and such)?"</p>
  <p> When you allow the emotional side of your brain to gain control, the conscious thinking side of your brain is suspended.</p>
  <p> Quick response is easily achieved when you curb the impulse to flare up emotionally.</p>
  <p> For starters, exercise discipline over yourself and be silent when emotionally confronted (see "<a href="EM/E042.html">Exercise 42 - Handling Criticism From People</a>").</p>
  <p> This will give you a chance to see how another person blows off steam without getting embroiled in the process yourself.</p>
  <p> It will also give you practice in achieving more conscious control over your life.</p>
  <p> Policemen, bar maids and customer relations officers all practice being 'cool' headed thinkers, because it is their job to handle emotional retorts in a calmer way.</p>
  <p> Lack of emotional control brings about inefficiency, non-productivity and little progress.</p>
  <p> Like with other things, practice is the key to improvement.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, work with a partner that you barely know.</p>
  <p> Agree ahead of time that this exercise is only a game, and that the object of the exercise is NOT to get antagonistic with each other over it.</p>
  <p> Now let your partner act as target, and you start bombarding him with emotionally directed remarks, one at a time.</p>
  <p> Your partner's job is to keep as cool and as calm as possible, and retort back to you a response as quickly as he can.</p>
  <p> A split second of clear thinking is all that is necessary, and soon you'll get the knack of it.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, reverse the roles.</p>
  <p> If done in a workshop, it might help to listen to other pairs performing the exercise.</p>
  <p> Often you'll find a response directed in the form of a calm question will take an emotional person off guard, because to consciously formulate an answer, the thinking side of the brain is needed.</p>
  <p> With practice, you'll no longer need to fumble for your words.</p>
  <p> Quick responses will become second nature to you.</p>
  <p> One way to get the words to flow quickly when you're upset is to simply read aloud a page out of a book as fast as you can.</p>
  <p> This is also a good method to use in pulling yourself out of a depressive, hateful or lonely mood (but not for chronic conditions).</p>
  <p> The conscious effort is so intense to keep the rapid speed going that your emotional doldrums simply pass away as your awareness is shifted to a cortical task.</p>
  <p> Time yourself for speed and read the same page again, but go faster this time.</p>
  <p> To think fast in emergency situations is often a matter of life and death in some cases.</p>
  <p> How would you handle yourself in a fire, a bad car accident, a robbery or on a passenger liner sinking at sea?</p>
  <p> Campers have died of cold exposure with packs containing food and cooking stoves.</p>
  <p> Car occupants have frozen to death in their cars with a half a tank of gas left.</p>
  <p> People have drowned in 4 feet of water.</p>
  <p> Panic is a killer.</p>
  <p> Determined, quick thinking is a life saver.</p>
  <p> Injured outdoorsmen have dragged their smashed bodies for miles and survived.</p>
  <p> Women have given birth to children in the wilderness all alone.</p>
  <p> People have performed amputations or crude surgery on themselves and saved their own lives.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, visualize yourself in emergency situations where you correctly choose a creative alternative for survival.</p>
  <p> For instance, after falling through the ice on a frozen river, you breathe from the shallow air pockets trapped underneath the ice.</p>
  <p> You bail out of an airplane and your primary and secondary chutes don't open, so you cut a slit in your pack and pull the chute out.</p>
  <p> While in an elevator, the cable snaps and you grab a hold of the ceiling fan to break your eventual fall to the ground.</p>
  <p> By creating visualizations where you are an active participant, you build selfconfidence and establish prepared scenarios in your mind to give you a better ability to handle yourself later.</p>
  <p> Even when totally different emergencies pop up, your readiness for them will produce better responses.</p>
