  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 75 </p><h1>Creating Palindromes</h1>
  <p> A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward.</p>
  <p> You store words in various ways in your mind.</p>
  <p> To search your mind for palindromes requires a special kind of brain accessing.</p>
  <p> Like an organic computer, the right "program" often can access the information you want.</p>
  <p> Some examples of palindromes are noon, radar, or "Madam, I'm Adam."</p>
  <p> By proceeding through the alphabet and quickly interchanging double consonants with various vowels, many 3-letter words can quickly be achieved, like DAD or GAG.</p>
  <p> By expanding your inner vision to interposing double vowels between double consonants 4-letter palindromes can be achieved, like NOON or DEED.</p>
  <p> By expanding your inner vision further still and thinking of one consonant straddled by a double vowel, you can roll through the alphabet for applicable double consonants, like EVE can become LEVEL and ADA can become MADAM or RADAR.</p>
  <p> Now list as many single word palindromes as you can think of, avoiding proper nouns.</p>
  <p> If you have trouble with this exercise, here’s a technique that might shake the cobwebs out of your head.</p>
  <p> It has been shown that utilization of a particular brain area for a task increases the electrical activity, blood volume and corresponding heat in that area - more blood into an area, more heat in that area.</p>
  <p> It has also been shown that raising the temperature of your head by 1°C increases the brain's ability to carry out certain complex mental activities like mathematics, visual puzzle-solving and better decision-making in 5% to 15% faster time.</p>
  <p> Now lower your head to a position under your chair for a few moments to increase the blood volume to your head and corresponding heat to your brain.</p>
  <p> Then raise your head and see if you can come up with more palindromes.</p>
