  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 66 </p><h1>Creating & Using Aphorisms</h1>
  <p> An aphorism is a short, pointed statement expressing a truth, doctrine or precept.</p>
  <p> Good aphoristic definitions of words allow you to experience feeling and imagination from the point of view of their originator.</p>
  <p> They convey a meaning and a truth that dictionary definitions lack.</p>
  <p> This exercise permits you to express and extend your own experiential quality and flavor to a word, and what it individualistically means to you.</p>
  <p> For example: Marriage - A lottery in which men stake their liberty and women their happiness.</p>
  <p> - Madame DiRieux One long conversation, checkered by disputes.</p>
  <p> - Robert Louis Stevenson Now create and write an aphorism for each of the following words:</p>
  <p> For example, Retirement is what men do when they die and women do when they marry.</p>
  <p> Retirement Politics Reality Happiness Creativity Power Love Tidiness An epithet is a descriptive word or phrase that expresses some real or implied quality of a person or thing in place of the name (e.g. "Charles the Great" for Charlemagne).</p>
  <p> Create a catchy epithet for each of the following: Atlantis George Washington Columbus Aztec Empire Roman Empire Ronald Reagan</p>
