  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 64 </p><h1>Problem Solving Via Drawings</h1>
  <p> One interesting technique that works wonders in problem solving is making drawings for yourself.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, for one week while you are conceptualizing your problems, carry a cheap small notebook and make drawings for yourself.</p>
  <p> Your drawings can be doodles, block diagrams, schematics, squiggles, sketches or whatever you wish.</p>
  <p> Observe which of these drawings helps you in problem solving and which do not.</p>
  <p> Drawings have an amazing power and ability to convey precise information, even if crudely done.</p>
  <p> Try it, you'll like it.</p>
  <p> Since art is basically a right brain activity, talk about your problems aloud to yourself while idly doodling and sketching anything which comes up.</p>
  <p> As a path to the subconscious is cleared, solutions will be automatically drawn in caricature or abstract form.</p>
  <p> If you choose the same room, chair and time of day for the exercise, daily repetition will eventually produce surprising results.</p>
  <p> Precede this exercise with relaxation, affirmation and deep breathing and you'll optimize your results.</p>
  <p> If you use your left hand (right brain) for sketching, this can often assist you in the generation of ideas.</p>
