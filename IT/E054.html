  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 54 </p><h1>Creating Clarity & Duration With Visualizations</h1>
  <p> Visualizations are directly associated with an unusual energy emitted by the mind.</p>
  <p> This energy can affect people and things depending upon its amplitude.</p>
  <p> Increasing your directional amplitude depends upon the clarity and duration of your visualization along with the purity of your belief structure; thus results vary from one person to another.</p>
  <p> With considerable practice, clear visualizations coupled with a firm belief system can coordinate this energy through you so you might perform feats of psychokinesis, telepathy, levitation and more.</p>
  <p> For example, an aikido master's thought process is so clear that he actually begins to toss an aggressor a split second before the moment that physical contact is made.</p>
  <p> When a karate grandmaster breaks a board, slow motion photography has shown that the board begins to break a split second before actual contact is made.</p>
  <p> This is the power of focused, clear thought in action.</p>
  <p> Most people visualize better than they believe they do.</p>
  <p> Sexual fantasies are a good example.</p>
  <p> You also visualize when you read a novel or listen to a story being told.</p>
  <p> Before the advent of TV, people relied heavily on radio stories and novels for their entertainment.</p>
  <p> They used their powers of visualization to see the story details in their mind's eye.</p>
  <p> TV eliminated the necessity of visualizing.</p>
  <p> Without practice in visualization, unused brain cells can deteriorate at an accelerated rate.</p>
  <p> To test your clarity and duration during visualization, sit still in a chair with your eyes closed and count from 1 to 100 while projecting onto your inner mental blackboard each numeral as you count.</p>
  <p> Stop counting when a stray thought intrudes and note the number.</p>
  <p> As with all skills though, practice can allow you to improve your visualization skills.</p>
  <p> Now visualize a cube consisting of 27 equal but smaller cubes (3 X 3 X 3).</p>
  <p> If the large cube is painted green on the outside, how many of the small cubes are painted on 3 sides? on 2 sides? on one side?</p>
  <p> How many cubes are unpainted?</p>
  <p> If you're having trouble with this, make the large cube the size of a house.</p>
  <p> Be an observer floating in the air around the house, counting the cubes.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in visualization improvement, imagine you have 3 apples in front of you in a row - the one on the left is red, the one in the center is yellow and the one on the right is green.</p>
  <p> Now in your mind's eye, move the one on the right to the center.</p>
  <p> Now move the one on the left to the position on the far right.</p>
  <p> Now again move the one that now is on the left to the position on the far right.</p>
  <p> Now move the one in the center to the far left.</p>
  <p> Do you have their correct order in mind?</p>
  <p> What color is the apple on the right, in the center, and on the left?</p>
  <p> If you're having trouble with this, shift your mental perspective so you are looking down on the apples or maybe even from the side.</p>
  <p> Practice on your own moving the apples around until it becomes easy for you.</p>
  <p> Practice and perfect your visualization skills.</p>
  <p> While listening to people talk, form mental images of the situations that are being described, and constantly strive to improve the clarity and duration of your mental imagery.</p>
