  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 67 </p><h1>Practicing Allegorical Thinking</h1>
  <p> An allegory is defined as a figurative discourse in which the principal subject is depicted by another subject resembling it in its properties and circumstances.</p>
  <p> It's like a sustained metaphor in a story format.</p>
  <p> By transmitting his messages in allegorical stories or parables, Jesus often got his disciples to think for themselves and arrive at their own conclusions on the subject he wanted to convey.</p>
  <p> Read the following allegorical account, then create your own allegory for a partner to listen to and see if he can conclude your message.</p>
  <p> Luke 13:6 "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</p>
  <p> Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p>
  <p> And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung (fertilize) it: And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down."</p>
  <p> Look at the issues below and weave an allegorical story around each of them.</p>
  <p> 1) Exemplify in allegory people that seek primarily money & material things throughout their lives vs seekers of primarily knowledge and wisdom.</p>
  <p> 2) Illustrate in allegory the chemical companies that profit off the continuous use of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides on crops vs the consumers ignorantly suffering the consequences of eating such crops.</p>
  <p> 3) Exemplify the U.S. policy in education vs the Japanese policy.</p>
  <p> You can look at the below example as a guide, but create your own allegory to describe each of the issues above.</p>
  <p> 1) Once there were 2 troupes of hungry monkeys.</p>
  <p> The members of the first troupe fought constantly over food supplies.</p>
  <p> They were gluttonous, wasteful and saved nothing.</p>
  <p> In lean times, they complained about their lacks and either starved or stole from other monkeys to survive.</p>
  <p> The second troupe of monkeys ate judiciously and stored food for the lean times.</p>
  <p> They were constantly seeking new avenues to different food supplies.</p>
  <p> These monkeys did not waste nor squander their food, and always had enough food as a result.</p>
  <p> Which method worked the best?</p>
