  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 73 </p><h1>Completion</h1>
  <p> The human mind has a tendency to want to complete things that look uncompleted.</p>
  <p> MY MIND IS GROWING MENTALLY STRONGER.</p>
  <p> If shown the top or bottom half of a sentence, the mind will still decipher the message.</p>
  <p> I AM GROWING MORE VERSATILE IN EVERY WAY.</p>
  <p> Many times problems keep rattling around in your mind going unresolved because you have not put the pieces together properly.</p>
  <p> As a thinking exercise in completion, have a partner take any book and turn to a typical page.</p>
  <p> Now have him choose a sentence and write on a blackboard or sheet of paper the words in a jumbled fashion.</p>
  <p> You then unscramble the words and make a complete sentence out of them.</p>
  <p> At first, choose small sentences and then advance to longer sentences as the exercise gets easier to do.</p>
  <p> This exercise equips the mind with a better facility for putting words together in an intelligible sequence for interpretation.</p>
  <p> Choose complete sentences in this exercise, not phrases or incomplete thoughts.</p>
  <p> For example: Every in abilities day way every my are mental improving.</p>
  <p> Becomes: My mental abilities are improving every day in every way.</p>
  <p> One interesting exercise to jog you into getting in touch with yourself is through the process of sentence completion.</p>
  <p> Pick something that angers or frustrates you, like your job or a relationship.</p>
  <p> Then write 8 to 12 endings to an incomplete sentence pertinent to the subject as rapidly and as spontaneously as possible.</p>
  <p> If you get stuck, invent a completion, but don't give up or stop.</p>
  <p> Continue on, regardless of whether any conflicting sentence completions pop up.</p>
  <p> Look at the following example: "If I were to admit that my present relationship is bad for me______" Possible Sentence Completions:</p>
  <p> 1) I'd have to have courage enough to break it off.</p>
  <p> 2) I'd have to face my friend's anguish.</p>
  <p> 3) I'd have to find someone new.</p>
  <p> 4) I'd have to face my own fear.</p>
  <p> 5) I'd hurt my friend.</p>
  <p> 6) I'd hurt myself.</p>
  <p> 7) I'd have to cope by myself.</p>
  <p> 8) I'd be alone.</p>
  <p> 9) I'd be afraid.</p>
  <p> 10) I could choose to be free.</p>
  <p> Another beginning sentence could be: "Love with my spouse (lover) means to me______" 1) || (continue with several completions) Let your spouse (lover) do the sentence completion after you do it. 1) || (continue with several completions) More simple sentence completions could be very revealing about your current state of mind, like: "People are______" or "My life is______" or "My work is______" Get the idea?</p>
  <p> Now choose a dilemma or problematic situation in your life and initiate the beginning of a sentence embodying it.</p>
  <p> Then begin listing possible sentence completions to see where it leads you.</p>
  <p> Some completed sentences might not make much sense, but others can be very revealing.</p>
  <p> You'll find though that the more you understand yourself, the easier it will be to understand others and you will think clearer too.</p>
