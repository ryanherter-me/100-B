  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 77 </p><h1>Learning To Brainstorm Problems</h1>
  <p> The brainstorming method of problem solving is a technique given its name by Alex Osborn, the founder of the advertising firm of Batten, Barten, Durstine and Osborn.</p>
  <p> Brainstorming groups usually consist of from 5 to 12 people who bombard a specific problem with diverse ideas.</p>
  <p> Four basic rules govern a brainstorming session:</p>
  <p> 1) Judgments of suggested ideas are suspended until later so that the group can proceed more with generating ideas than defending them.</p>
  <p> Negative looks, expressions and mannerism should be avoided by members.</p>
  <p> Avoid even "That's a good idea" type remarks, because they are still judgments.</p>
  <p> 2) Participants are encouraged to think of the wildest most spontaneous ideas possible and attack the problem with no holds barred.</p>
  <p> 3) An enthusiastic quantity of ideas is encouraged, because quantity increases the likelihood of obtaining some good solutions.</p>
  <p> 4) Participants are encouraged to build upon the ideas of the others to turn them into better ideas or modify two or more ideas in combination to produce a better idea.</p>
  <p> Brainstorming's growth came from a 12-man brainstorm panel which is still the size frequently used, although 7-member teams have become quite popular as well.</p>
  <p> To create a brainstorm panel, select people with a diversity of specialties, attitudes and backgrounds and perhaps only one member being very familiar with the material being brainstormed.</p>
  <p> Define the problem specifically and simply, avoiding vagueness and generality.</p>
  <p> As a brainstorm leader, diplomatically guide the group without creating a forbidding atmosphere.</p>
  <p> Like a good team captain, stay in the background yourself and do not to take credit for the group's progress and accomplishments.</p>
  <p> Create an atmosphere of encouragement and select a location conducive to good results.</p>
  <p> For instance, holding a brainstorming session in an uncomfortable or noisy office could prove inhibiting.</p>
  <p> On the other hand, yellow walls, modern art and a bit of music in the background all seem to contribute to creativity in brainstorming rooms.</p>
  <p> A written record of the session's ideas should be kept.</p>
  <p> When later these ideas are evaluated for their usefulness, the entire list will serve as a basis for possible solutions.</p>
  <p> The principal value of group brainstorming is the fact that it can produce far more good ideas than a conventional conference, and in far less time.</p>
  <p> In actual practice, a brainstorming session can even be used by yourself, if you adhere to the same four basic rules.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, apply these same rules to a problem of your own without any group assistance.</p>
  <p> Secure a comfortable and quiet surrounding.</p>
  <p> With pencil and paper, write a sentence specifically outlining your problem.</p>
  <p> Surprisingly, simply defining the situation begins to produce a flurry of possible solutions.</p>
  <p> When the flurry starts, write down key words without elaboration to allow the flow to rapidly proceed along.</p>
  <p> To facilitate the definition process, write at least 3 additional ways of outlining the problem.</p>
  <p> What is it you really want or find dis-satisfactory in your present situation?</p>
  <p> Realize that all problems appear simple after the solution is found.</p>
  <p> See in your mind's eye the pleasant outcome to finding the solution.</p>
  <p> Separate the problem into segments to make the steps in solving it more manageable.</p>
  <p> And finally, once the pondering has been completed, initiate some kind of action toward achieving results.</p>
  <p> You'll find that getting started on it carries a momentum that creates a vibration to figuring the rest out along the way.</p>
  <p> Be courageous and trust in yourself.</p>
  <p> Everything is far simpler if you look at it that way.</p>
  <p> Practice internal brainstorming on different problems and soon a free flow of thoughts will become a natural process.</p>
  <p> Brainstorming Problem: Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, and the U.S. has one of the highest crime rates.</p>
  <p> What procedure can be used to sharply reduce the crime rate in America quickly?</p>
