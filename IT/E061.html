  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 61 </p><h1>Creative Thinking (Aims, Goals, Objectives)</p>
  <p> Learn to define your aims, goals and objectives in life's situations.</p>
  <p> Make a list of all your reasons for doing a particular thing.</p>
  <p> Even though you assume that you know what your goals are, often hidden or unconsidered goals get in the way.</p>
  <p> Without a clarity of purpose, all actions are either reactions to a situation or matters of habit or imitation.</p>
  <p> As a practice exercise, write down all your possible aims, goals and objectives as if you were a captain of a spaceship approaching Earth for the first time from another planet.</p>
  <p> Did you create a long list?</p>
  <p> Now do the same thing with something in your own life.</p>
  <p> A tennis player that kept delivering kill shots into the net thought his goal was to win the game, but in reality it was an undetected desire to look terrific.</p>
  <p> As another exercise, look at how you currently do your daily chores and duties throughout your day.</p>
  <p> Now put on your creative hat and think about how you could possible perform your daily tasks but in a creatively different way.</p>
  <p> This exercise relieves you of the habit that often restricts you to one way thinking and doing things.</p>
  <p> The more you practice accomplishing things in novel ways, the better you get at it.</p>
  <p> You can think wild or standard, active or inactive, open-minded or narrow-minded.</p>
  <p> The choice is yours, but practice wearing different thinking hats.</p>
  <p> Sometimes it helps the process by assuming a role and saying - if I were Jesus, Einstein or the President, how would I think?</p>
