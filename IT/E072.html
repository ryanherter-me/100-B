  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 72 </p><h1>Memorizing Sayings</h1>
  <p> Actors learn to memorize long lines and passages.</p>
  <p> Have you ever heard proverbs and sayings that you liked, but never bothered to commit them to your memory?</p>
  <p> Like new vocabulary words, to incorporate a new saying to your repertory of picturesque speech, it really doesn't take that much time or trouble at all.</p>
  <p> To illustrate a point or to make a subject entertaining, anecdotal material is often helpful whether it is of your own creation or from others.</p>
  <p> To get in the frame of mind to memorize sayings, it can help to create some for yourself first to prime the mental pump so to speak.</p>
  <p> Think for 60 seconds and contrive 2 sayings of your own originality, and write them down.</p>
  <p> For example: Those who know the least know it the loudest.</p>
  <p> The future isn't what it used to be.</p>
  <p> Now memorize the following 3 sayings and their authors in the next 5 minutes and show yourself how simple it is.</p>
  <p> When you do this, give your recitations of the passages a singing intonation to throw the information to the right brain.</p>
  <p> For most right-handed people, it can also improve your auditory recall and recitation by shifting your eyes to the left (the opposite is often true with left-handed people).</p>
  <p> An eye movement to the left seems to activate the brain's auditory memory area.</p>
  <p> The great end to life is not knowledge, but action.</p>
  <p> Thomas Henry Huxley Man is what he believes.</p>
  <p> Anton Chekhov When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it happened or not.</p>
  <p> Mark Twain</p>
