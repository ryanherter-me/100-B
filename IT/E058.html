  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 58 </p><h1>Mastering Analytical Thinking</h1>
  <p> Mental exercise brings about brain stimulation, which brings about growth.</p>
  <p> Unfortunately, the average person doesnâ€™t exercise their brain too much.</p>
  <p> Here are some reasoning problems that will STRE-E-TCH your mental 'muscles,' and provide you with some fun.</p>
  <p> 1) A man looks at a picture of a man on the wall and says "Brothers and sisters, I have none; but that man's father is my father's son!"</p>
  <p> Who is the man in the picture?</p>
  <p> 2) There are 3 cartons containing 2 hats each.</p>
  <p> In one carton there are 2 black hats; in another there are 2 white hats; and in a third, there is a white hat and a black hat.</p>
  <p> There are 3 labels BB - WW - WB placed incorrectly on each carton.</p>
  <p> You are to label the cartons correctly, and for identification purposes, you can pull out as many hats as necessary.</p>
  <p> What is the minimum number of hats that must be looked at to accomplish the correct labeling job and why?</p>
  <p> 3) If a duck and a half lays an egg and a half in a day and a half, how many eggs would 6 ducks lay in 6 days?</p>
  <p> 4) Jim and John are both older than Joe.</p>
  <p> Lorraine is younger than Jim, but older than John.</p>
  <p> Marge is older than Jim.</p>
  <p> Who is the youngest and who is next to the youngest?</p>
  <p> 5) With each letter representing one number, identify the correct numbers in the subtraction problem.</p>
  <p> ZBZ - CZ ZB 100</p>
  <p> INNOVATIVE THINKING ANSWERS:</p>
  <p> 1) His son.</p>
  <p> 2) You only need to take one hat from the carton labeled WB.</p>
  <p> If it is black, then the carton must contain two black hats since the WB label is wrong.</p>
  <p> If it is white, then the carton must contain 2 white hats.</p>
  <p> After the BB or WW carton has been established, the other 2 cartons are simply marked opposite of the 2 remaining choices.</p>
  <p> BB Contents Labeled: Labeled: WW Contents WB Contents WB BB WW WW Contents WB Contents BB Contents WB BB WW 3) If a duck and a half lays an egg and a half in a day and a half, it would lay twice as many eggs in twice the time.</p>
  <p> Therefore, in three days it would lay 3 eggs and in 6 days it would lay 6 eggs.</p>
  <p> If a duck and a half lays 6 eggs in 6 days then 6 ducks (being 4 times greater than one and a half) would lay 4 times 6 or 24 eggs in the 6 days.</p>
  <p> 4) Joe is the youngest, and John is the next to the youngest.</p>
  <p> 5) 101 - 91 10.</p>
