  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 62 </p><h1>Creative Thinking (Not The Obvious)</h1>
  <p> In a Peter Sellers Pink Panther movie, Sellers looked down at a dog at his feet and asked the proprietor of the hotel that he was checking into, "Does your dog bite?"</p>
  <p> The proprietor said, "No."</p>
  <p> Whereupon Sellers reached down to pet the dog and got bit!</p>
  <p> Inquiring about it, he found out that the dog at his feet was not the proprietor's dog.</p>
  <p> Before making a decision, consider all the factors without taking what seems obvious for granted.</p>
  <p> In analytical thinking, you proceed directly from one state of information to another state.</p>
  <p> In creative thinking, you generate new ideas and approaches by extending yourself through imagination, intuition and inspiration to exceed the obvious.</p>
  <p> Keep this in mind when solving the following problems.</p>
  <p> 1) For example, how many squares are in the figure below?</p>
  <p> 2) Draw 4 connecting straight lines so they pass through all the following dots: 3) A truck went under a low bridge and got jammed so precisely that the driver could neither go forward nor backward.</p>
  <p> Mechanics could not pry the truck loose, but a small boy came by and told them how to get the truck out with little difficulty.</p>
  <p> What did he tell them?</p>
  <p> 4) In Europe, there is a brandy that is bottled with a whole pear in each bottle.</p>
  <p> How does the bottler put the pear into the bottle?</p>
  <p> 5) In the following illustration, you are in a room with a dish, a tennis ball and a mouse trap.</p>
  <p> How can you tie the 2 strings together?</p>
  <p> ANSWERS:</p>
  <p> 1) Analytical thinkers would say 16 or 17 (large square included).</p>
  <p> Creative thinkers see 30 squares, including the 4 X 4 and 3 X 3 squares.</p>
  <p> 2)</p>
  <p> 3) Let some air out of the tires.</p>
  <p> 4) The bottle is tied to the tiny growing pear on the branch.</p>
  <p> 5) Attach the mousetrap to one string and swing it to you while running to grab the other string in time to catch the swinging string and mousetrap.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, pick a problem - say poor education.</p>
  <p> Now pick a random word in the dictionary - say the 7th word on the 7th page - apple.</p>
  <p> See what thoughts the word apple will generate in terms of the problem.</p>
  <p> For example, apple - fruit - kids like fruit - kids bring apples to school - better teaching, better education.</p>
  <p> Do the same thing with other random words for other problems.</p>
  <p> Thinking creatively takes practice.</p>
  <p> Begin looking around in your life for things that can give you creative self-expression.</p>
  <p> You can decorate your house in some creative way.</p>
  <p> You can dress in creative ways.</p>
  <p> Go to new or wacky locations for entertainment.</p>
  <p> Look for ideas everywhere.</p>
  <p> Draw, paint, play with clay, write songs, play a new musical instrument and have fun with yourself.</p>
  <p> When faced with a particular challenge, problem or situation, write a list of possible solutions, no matter how far out!</p>
  <p> There are no wrong answers, just possible solutions!</p>
  <p> Generate a flow of ideas.</p>
  <p> The act of writing them down often gets them out of the mind and into view for you to see.</p>
  <p> Ask others for input, and listen to what they say, but don’t tell them your ideas on the subject if they’re not positively oriented.</p>
  <p> Some people have a habit of derailing another point of view automatically, and this can be discouraging.</p>
  <p> In every situation you are in, consciously ask yourself how to best handle it creatively.</p>
  <p> This establishes a habit of thinking creatively.</p>
  <p> Don’t worry about whether your ideas will work or not.</p>
  <p> Worrying impedes the flow of creativity.</p>
  <p> The idea here is to practice thinking creatively until it becomes a habit.</p>
