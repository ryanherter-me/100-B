  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 65 </p><h1>Creating Metaphors and Similes</h1>
  <p> Metaphorical thinking is the ability to make connections between two unlike things by recognizing that in some way they share a mutual trait or exemplify a common principle.</p>
  <p> A simile more specifically connects these two dissimilar things with the words "like" or "as."</p>
  <p> A metaphor provides you with an extremely efficient way to organize and remember information.</p>
  <p> It brings your own experience into focus and it can be a lot of fun.</p>
  <p> Aristotle once said, "The greatest thing by far is to be a master of the metaphor."</p>
  <p> Now create metaphors & similes around any of the following words - Love, Confidence, Genius, Music, Pollution, Curiosity - What animals, plants, colors, shapes, minerals or other things are metaphorically like the above words?</p>
  <p> Here are some examples to get you started:</p>
  <p> 1) LOVE is like a pure spring rain gently stimulating my entire being.</p>
  <p> 2) Demonstrating CONFIDENCE is like opening the envelope of courage.</p>
  <p> 3) A spoonful of GENIUS can dispel an ocean of the unknown.</p>
  <p> 4) The diversity of MUSIC is like the spectrum of light, visible and invisible in its range of appreciation.</p>
  <p> 5) World POLLUTION is like a disintegrating work of art.</p>
  <p> 6) The light of CURIOSITY can puncture the abyss of ignorance.</p>
