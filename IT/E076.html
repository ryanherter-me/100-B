  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 76 </p><h1>Mind Mapping</h1>
  <p> An innovation of Tony Buzan, the mind map evolved from his research in note taking techniques.</p>
  <p> A mind map consists of a central word or concept, around which you draw 5 to 10 main ideas that relate to that word or concept.</p>
  <p> Then you take each of those words and draw 5 to 10 main ideas that relate to each of those words.</p>
  <p> New ideas can be placed in the right place and the map encourages the reduction of each idea to a single word.</p>
  <p> A mind map is a way to organize your thoughts or ideas around a major theme or subject, and assist you in making brain linkages and connections for better recall later.</p>
  <p> You can apply the mind map principle to a variety of situations, whether it’s a book you just read, a lecture you just heard, or a vision you just had - creating a mind map around its central theme can bring clarity and order to your thoughts, and you can depict it all on a single sheet of paper.</p>
  <p> Research by Tony Buzan on note taking revealed that out of the various methods of learning after a lecture - writing transcripts, writing summaries or writing key words - key words written by the student was the most effective way of remembering a lecture given to them.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in creating mind maps, use the below skeleton of a simple mind map and improvise from there with sample words or ideas that relate to the central theme of a book you just read or a movie you just saw and see how effective it is for organizing your thoughts.</p>
  <p> You’ll also find that reviewing your mind map later will bring the summary or essence of the book or movie back quickly to you.</p>
  <p> Also if the book or movie is particularly important for you to learn and retain, redrawing the mind map from memory a few times will implant the information very solidly in your memory.</p>
