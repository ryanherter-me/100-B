  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 68 </p><h1>Word Creation</h1>
  <p> Out of the name, Marilyn Monroe, make as many words as you can of 3 letters or more from the letters in the name that are not foreign words, abbreviations, contractions, proper names or slang.</p>
  <p> Time yourself for 2 minutes.</p>
  <p> This simple exercise increases your imaging ability as well as your ability to see things from various angles.</p>
  <p> Practicing this in a timed condition improves your alacrity of mind too.</p>
  <p> Now take another name and do the same thing, but write all the words backwards, instead of forwards.</p>
  <p> As an intuitive variation to this exercise, use the name of someone with which you are currently involved or with which you are contemplating a relationship, and write as many meaningful words as you can using only the letters in their name.</p>
  <p> Oftentimes, you will find that single words or groups of two words or more put together will carry a message of importance to you about this person or your involvement with this person.</p>
  <p> Now list as many 3-letter words as you can on a separate sheet of paper that contain the letter "G" in the word.</p>
  <p> Time yourself for 3 minutes.</p>
  <p> If you got over 25 you did well.</p>
  <p> Next, write as many words of any length as you can with the letter "J" in them, but not being the first letter of the word.</p>
  <p> Time yourself for 3 minutes.</p>
  <p> If you got over 25, you're on the way to mental mastery.</p>
  <p> Write as many 4 letter words as you can where the following pairs of letters come in the beginning, middle or end of the word.</p>
  <p> For example, if your letter pair was at you could write oats and atom and chat.</p>
  <p> Now time yourself for 2 minutes on each of the following pairs of letters and see how many words you can create.</p>
