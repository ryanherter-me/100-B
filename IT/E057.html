  <p>INNOVATIVE THINKING</p><p>Exercise 57 </p><h1>Shredding The Envelope In Your Thinking</h1>
  <p> In a highly competitive business world, oftentimes just stretching the envelope is not enough!</p>
  <p> You have to shred it!!</p>
  <p> You must set yourself apart from your competitors by not just thinking outside the box, but outside of the room or even the world!</p>
  <p> People often assume that because they have a brain, they automatically must know how to think.</p>
  <p> Right?!</p>
  <p> To think well requires practice, and like any skill, the more you practice, the better you get at it.</p>
  <p> This is a small warm-up exercise in learning how to think outside your boundaries and as warm-ups, here are a few initial problems to get your motor started.</p>
  <p> 1) How many months have 30 days?</p>
  <p> 2) Count out loud from 10 to 1, backwards.</p>
  <p> 3) Is it legal for a man to marry his widow's sister?</p>
  <p> 4) What is the volume of dirt (in cubic feet) in a hole that measures 4 feet by 5 feet by 18 inches?</p>
  <p> Now look at the answers on the next page and see the kind of thinking you must employ to solve these problems.</p>
  <p> With that in mind, tackle the following problems and see how much easier they become:</p>
  <p> 1) Two young girls were born of the same mother on the same day of the year.</p>
  <p> Although they readily admit to being sisters, they deny being twins.</p>
  <p> How can this be?</p>
  <p> 2) A young man and his father are in a car accident.</p>
  <p> The father is killed and the young man is rushed into the hospital.</p>
  <p> The attending doctor exclaims, "That's my son!"</p>
  <p> What is the explanation?</p>
  <p> 3) A hunter walks 2 miles south from his campsite, 5 miles west, then 2 miles north and he finds himself back at his campsite.</p>
  <p> A bear is eating his supplies and he shoots it.</p>
  <p> What color is the bear?</p>
  <p> 4) If a bacterial strain doubles its growth each day in a petri dish and the petri dish is full on March 30, what day was it half full?</p>
  <p> Answers to first set: 1) 11 2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 3) No, he's dead.</p>
  <p> 4) A hole has no dirt in it.</p>
  <p> Answers to second set: 1) They were born in different years.</p>
  <p> 2) The doctor is his mother.</p>
  <p> 3) The bear is white and at the North Pole.</p>
  <p> 4) March 29 When Ulysses S.</p>
  <p> Grant was a boy, he watched several grown men thrown off a stubborn mule, one by one.</p>
  <p> Since a circus operator was offering money to anyone who could ride the mule for a certain length of time, Grant decided to give it a try.</p>
  <p> On the first try he was thrown off.</p>
  <p> On the second try, he attacked the problem in a surprise way.</p>
  <p> He mounted the mule backwards and wrapped his legs around its belly while grabbing a hold of the tail.</p>
  <p> The mule could not throw him off.</p>
  <p> You can always be open to surprise possibilities in your life.</p>
  <p> Look for the unlikely in everything.</p>
  <p> Consider the unthinkable and ponder the improbable.</p>
  <p> Lifeâ€™s greatest opportunities are often disguised.</p>
  <p> Now go out and solve problems in your own life in a novel or surprising way.</p>
