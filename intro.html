  <p> So prepare yourself for a better future, and use this manual to improve yourself, while noting in your notebook any changes in your life as you recognize them.</p>
  <p> You'll find the world a far more interesting and adventurous place when you do.</p>
  <p> Since The 100% Brain Course is a self-study program, you'll find it helpful to establish a routine involving several of the manual's exercise each day.</p>
  <p> With this plan or road map as your guide, you can make more effective progress in your growth.</p>
  <p> The following sample can guide you, but depending upon your personal preferences arising from your own individual needs and objectives, you can change the exercise routine to suit yourself.</p>
  <p> But remember, commit yourself to taking action every day toward your goal of improvement, then reward yourself by celebrating every milestone you make!</p>
  <p> 1) Just before arising from bed in the morning, pause for a moment and don't get up.</p>
  <p> Relax and contemplate any dream recollections you just had.</p>
  <p> Ask yourself what symbolic significance such a dream could have had for you.</p>
  <p> Assume your subconscious mind provided those images to you for a reason.</p>
  <p> By asking yourself what that reason might be while relaxed and immediately after awakening, your subconscious mind oftentimes will provide you with an instructive answer for the day (<a href="GM/E166.html">Exercise 166 - Problem-Solving During Sleep</a>).</p>
  <p> 2) When you do arise from your bed, give yourself a quick self-massage (<a href="HS/E100.html">Exercise 100 - Self-Massage</a>) and reiterate confident healing messages to yourself, like "I am strong & healthy," "I feel good about myself," "All areas of my body are filled with invigorating energy," etc.</p>
  <p> (<a href="EM/E006.html">Exercise 6 - Positive Affirming, Positive Living</a>).</p>
  <p> 3) As you go through your morning ritual, be as conscious as possible without going unconsciously into an automatic mode (<a href="HS/E119.html">Exercise 119 - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness</a>).</p>
  <p> To assist this process, do things in a different order than usual or use your non-dominant hand for various tasks, like twisting off bottle caps, stirring your coffee, combing your hair, brushing your teeth or buttoning a garment (<a href="MT/E124.html">Exercise 124 - Learning To Be Ambidextrous</a>).</p>
  <p> 4) While going to work, reiterate positive statements to yourself about what you want to do, how you want it to happen and visualize yourself in the positive process all the way through to its completion (Exercise - Imagine and Mind Walk THE 100% BRAIN COURSE Your Goals).</p>
  <p> 5) Open up your mind and consciously drink in the sights, sounds, odors and bumps in the road as you drive to work.</p>
  <p> Observe the street signs and billboards and play at spelling the words backwards to yourself as you pass them (<a href="SM/E080.html">Exercise 80 - Attention To Detail</a>).</p>
  <p> 6) At work, make a point of delivering some complimentary word each hour to your work mates.</p>
  <p> Find someone you normally have difficulty with and sincerely compliment him (her) in a positive way on something unique to their personality (<a href="EM/E041.html">Exercise 41 - Skillful People Handling</a>).</p>
  <p> 7) Study people and step into their shoes and imagine what they are feeling and experiencing (<a href="GM/E206.html">Exercise 206 - Role Taking As An Actor</a>).</p>
  <p> See if you can tell what is going on inside their head or bothering them (<a href="GM/E208.html">Exercise 208 - Scanning A Person</a>).</p>
  <p> Ask yourself how they would experience what you are experiencing (Exercise - Experiencing Another Person's Senses).</p>
  <p> Note their mannerisms.</p>
  <p> Are they sincere, truthful, internally angry, confident or intently attentive (<a href="GM/E209.html">Exercise 209 - Discerning Body Language</a>).</p>
  <p> You'll get better at this as you become more aware of your own internal workings.</p>
  <p> 8) When you first meet someone new, take conscious note of their name and ask them how it is spelled (see <a href="SM/E089.html">Exercise 89 - Remembering Names</a>).</p>
  <p> Study that person's face, clothes and demeanor and note any unusual features.</p>
  <p> Caricaturize something ridiculous about those features for better recall later (see <a href="SM/E079.html">Exercise 79 - Ridiculous Associations</a>).</p>
  <p> 9) When eating your daily meals, consciously attend to the process.</p>
  <p> Observe the food intently, smell it, chew it slowly, savor the subtle flavors and how your teeth, tongue and gums react to each morsel (<a href="HS/E119.html">Exercise 119 - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness</a>).</p>
  <p> 10) If you become tense, tired or scattered during the day, focus on breathing rhythmically and deeply for a few minutes (<a href="EM/E026.html">Exercise 26 - Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes</a>).</p>
  <p> At this time, tune inwardly and ask yourself for inner guidance (<a href="GM/E164.html">Exercise 164 - Asking For Inner Guidance</a>).</p>
  <p> 11) Before retiring at night, relax in your bed and mentally visualize in a quick series of images all the events that happened to you throughout the day (<a href="GM/E154.html">Exercise 154 - Daily Visualization</a>).</p>
  <p> Reiterate positive statements to yourself as you breathe slowly and rhythmically to yourself.</p>
  <p> Visualize any goals you have in a series of images through to completion with total personal involvement and confidence that you will achieve them. (see <a href="GM/E146.html">Exercise 146 - Obtaining Money & Material Things</a>).</p>
  <p> THE 100% BRAIN COURSE Some Preparatory Thoughts Before Doing The Exercises.</p>
  <p> 1.Calm yourself and your mind before doing the exercises.</p>
  <p> 2.Be prepared to DO the action necessary to accomplish each exercise.</p>
  <p> If necessary, make a pact or commitment with yourself to do the exercise as outlined so you know you’ve struck a deal with yourself.</p>
  <p> 3.Understand that the exercises cannot fix you -- you are responsible for yourself.</p>
  <p> Only you can fix you.</p>
  <p> 4.Be fully honest at all times with yourself.</p>
  <p> Keep a daily journal and tell yourself what’s on your mind before each day’s exercise routine.</p>
  <p> 5.If you don't like something that is going on in your life, say so.</p>
  <p> Then ask yourself what action you can take to fix it.</p>
  <p> 6.Recognize that progress comes one step at a time, and be prepared to decide on each step to be taken.</p>
  <p> Then take action so that your goals can become reality.</p>
  <p> 7.Be still and listen to your inner self-guidance.</p>
  <p> Hear your inner voice without any preconceptions and without overlaying it with the thought patterns that have held you back in the past.</p>
  <p> 9.Recognize that outer and inner changes will most likely happen together, because one is unlikely to occur without the other.</p>
  <p> 10.Be open to success, and to wonderful changes in your life.</p>
  <p> Expect them, demand them and know they will come.</p>
  <p> The 100% Brain Course is unique in that it covers a wide arrangement of exercises, spanning a full spectrum of brain stimulation, from emotional to physical to mental to spiritual.</p>
  <p> You must understand that it is not so much a matter of technique that allows a person to do extraordinary things that seem to transcend the physical laws of what we currently know as science.</p>
  <p> It is the spiritual development and awareness of the individual with his faith and belief in himself and his connectivity to everything else that allows extraordinary things to be possible through a person.</p>
  <p> The process of transformation must begin in the beginning.</p>
  <p> Advanced exercises should only be attempted after mastering preliminary exercises first.</p>
  <p> “If a master does the same thing as you do, -- is it the same thing at all?”</p>
