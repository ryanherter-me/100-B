  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 200 </p><h1>High Speed Listening</h1>
  <p> Are you "hard of listening" instead of "hard of hearing?</p>
  <p> Do you really listen to people or are you always thinking about what YOU are ready to say when someone is talking to you?</p>
  <p> This exercise in speed listening will focus your listening abilities.</p>
  <p> How fast does your mind assimilate verbal information?</p>
  <p> Translators at the United Nations reiterate translations as the original language is spoken.</p>
  <p> Other people have the faculty of being able to repeat any spoken words a split second after other people have said them, and sometimes even backwards!</p>
  <p> Newscasters learn to read their news material fast, steadily and without frequent errors.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in listening intently, play a cassette tape with a lecture dialogue on it.</p>
  <p> As you listen to it, repeat what you hear word for word into a cassette recorder.</p>
  <p> Then afterwards, compare both recordings for accuracy.</p>
  <p> If you read at a rate of only 200 - 300 words per minute, your attention will no doubt wander from time to time.</p>
  <p> This absent-mindedness often requires regression over the same material again and again.</p>
  <p> The same phenomenon sometimes occurs when listening to a monotone lecturer that is speaking at a rate of 125 - 150 words per minute.</p>
  <p> Your attention wanders and little is absorbed.</p>
  <p> By listening to a process of compressed or speeded-up tapes, a delivery rate of 350 words per minute can be easily assimilated by your brain.</p>
  <p> Dr. Sally R. McCracken at Detroit's Wayne State University uses a technique of editing tapes to remove portions of recorded material.</p>
  <p> By taking out pauses between words and by shortening the time needed to make vowel sounds, Dr.</p>
  <p> McCracken uses a special machine that scans an audio tape and cuts out these short segments of "needless sound.</p>
  <p> Originally used by blind listeners, it was found that besides reducing listening time, the system also aids comprehension by forcing listeners to concentrate more intently.</p>
  <p> In the early 1970's, Sandy Greenberg, an engineering student at Columbia University, discovered that he was going blind.</p>
  <p> Desiring to learn as much information in the shortest possible time, Greenberg approached a friend, Murray Schiffman, who set to work on a technique for varying the playback speed of recorded tapes without affecting the pitch.</p>
  <p> Tape hobbyists knew, for example, that when you played back a tape at twice the speed at which it was recorded, it was difficult or impossible to understand.</p>
  <p> For one thing, the speaker's voice was automatically raised a full octave, out of the range of normal speech intelligibility.</p>
  <p> The technique had been used for comic effect in earlier days with the series of novelty song hits featuring Alvin and the Chipmunks.</p>
  <p> So what Schiffman eventually came up with was a circuit that would play back recorded material at variable speeds without altering the pitch, and with up to 100% increase or decrease without losing intelligibility.</p>
  <p> The technique is now called variable speech control or VSC.</p>
  <p> Corporations began using speed listening cassette players to save valuable training time and money.</p>
  <p> It was found that most of the students using VSC liked listening at faster than normal rates.</p>
  <p> Tests showed that speeds from about 1.75 to 2.0 times normal (about 275 - 300 wpm) improved comprehension and retention.</p>
  <p> In looking for ways to speed up the training process, speech compression seemed to be the best idea, because 90% of the course work was self-instructional.</p>
  <p> Depending upon the quality of the tape recording device, information can be progressively speeded up to 10 or 20 times normal speed and still be intelligibly assimilated.</p>
  <p> For this exercise, you need to create just such a tape first.</p>
  <p> Assume a self-hypnotic state and use the time distortion technique with a metronome (review "<a href="/GM/E176.html">Exercise 176 - Learning Self-Hypnosis</a>" and "<a href="/GM/E179.html">Exercise 179 - Learn Through Time Distortion</a>").</p>
  <p> Indicate when you have achieved a time distorted perception by saying to an assistant, "I'm ready.</p>
  <p> At this point, the information tape is played to you through a head set at the high speed rate.</p>
  <p> You'll find that with practice, greater quantities of information can be absorbed in this way in a shorter span of time.</p>
