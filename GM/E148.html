  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 148 </p><h1>Pain Away Breathing</h1>
  <p> This exercise for the relief of minor pain is based on following the beats of your heart, so sit or lie down in a relaxed position.</p>
  <p> Feel your pulse and begin by counting the beats aloud, until you get a sense of the rhythm.</p>
  <p> Inhale through your nose to the count of 6, hold it to the count of 3, exhale to the count of 6, pause for 3 counts; then repeat the process.</p>
  <p> While inhaling, visualize energy being sent to the painful area to repair damaged cells and reestablish proper circulation.</p>
  <p> When exhaling, imagine the pain exiting the body.</p>
  <p> Repeat this cycle 7 times; then rest.</p>
  <p> Repeat the process two more times in sets of 7.</p>
  <p> To provide variety to the exercise, breathe in the color orange during the procedure above (or whatever other color your inner self deems more suitable).</p>
  <p> This breathing technique not only eliminates pain, but also many negative emotional feelings as well.</p>
  <p> Also, since laughter releases pain-relieving endorphins into your system, artificially laugh occasionally to assist the process of pain relief.</p>
