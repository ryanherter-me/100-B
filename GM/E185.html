  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 185 </p><h1>Astral Projection Adventures</h1>
  <p> After achieving an astral projection (see "E<a href="GM/E184.html">Exercise 184 - Astral Projection Techniques</a>"), what do you do then?</p>
  <p> Since you cannot fall or hurt yourself, do some exploring and drift about the room from ceiling to closet, but stay calm.</p>
  <p> The first time that you are out of the body CONSCIOUSLY will be a totally new experience, so don't become too startled by it.</p>
  <p> Hover near your body and scrutinize it.</p>
  <p> A little shocking, isn't it?</p>
  <p> You never saw all the imperfections so vividly before?!</p>
  <p> It's like the first time you heard your own voice on a tape recorder.</p>
  <p> You didn't quite believe it was you!</p>
  <p> You'll notice the shape of all parts of your body, your complexion, the lines in your face, etc.</p>
  <p> If you advance a little further and look into your brain, you'll see little quirks and phobias that may even cause you to jump back into your body out of sheer fright!</p>
  <p> After this initial encounter with yourself, you'll have to decide what to do next.</p>
  <p> Perhaps you can visit a close friend or relative.</p>
  <p> If so, visualize the person in considerable detail.</p>
  <p> Visualize where he or she lives and precisely how to get there.</p>
  <p> Since astral travel is new to you, project yourself along the same route that you would normally take to get to their house.</p>
  <p> By doing this, you'll find that almost instantly you'll be there.</p>
  <p> Once there, you may even have a conversation with your friend, but since you are not conversing with his physical self, he probably will not remember it later.</p>
  <p> If he remembers anything, it may only seem like a wispy dream from his subconscious.</p>
  <p> If his level of awareness is higher, he might remember everything.</p>
  <p> With practice, you will find that you can visit any place -- high mountains, sacred temples, secret libraries (for all languages are interpretable in the astral), even the moon or other planets!</p>
  <p> By sleeping on your books and extending your astral body a short distance into them, you can even assimilate their contents into your subconscious.</p>
  <p> Making conscious use of the subconscious well of knowledge takes a little more practice.</p>
  <p> When you're on an astral journey it's impossible for you to get lost or to harm yourself or to find that your body has been taken over.</p>
  <p> If another entity comes near your physical body while you are out of it, you will be reeled in with the speed of thought.</p>
  <p> So DON'T be afraid.</p>
  <p> You may meet lower and higher forms of life in the astral, but remember, they can do you NO harm.</p>
  <p> Your own fear is the only real harm you can incur.</p>
  <p> You will find that in the astral, colors appear more brilliant that in the physical.</p>
  <p> You will also find that if you want to go to one place and a stray thought about another place occurs, your path is immediately directed to the other place.</p>
  <p> In the astral, a thought is followed by automatic action.</p>
  <p> When you want to return to the physical body, simply 'think' about going back and getting into your physical body.</p>
  <p> In a blur of speed you will be back in your room viewing your fleshly body again.</p>
  <p> Let your astral body sink back into your physical body very slowly to allow a perfect synchronizing to take place.</p>
  <p> Sometimes if you go back suddenly and clumsily, there will be a misaligning that takes place.</p>
  <p> You may find that you will physically rise up with a headache of some kind.</p>
  <p> If this happens, simply sleep for a little while and allow the alignment to readjust itself naturally.</p>
  <p> Once back in the body though, you will almost find a sensation of disappointment.</p>
  <p> Your flesh-body appears stiff and heavy.</p>
  <p> Colors appear dimmer again.</p>
  <p> Sounds are less noticeable and even inaudible in your fleshly body.</p>
  <p> With practice and with the elimination of fear, astral travel can become both educational and pleasurable.</p>
