  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 168 </p><h1>Intuition, Hunches and Decisions</h1>
  <p> Do you often experience mental chatter going on in the back of your mind, but every now and then something 'clear' pops up that tells you to do this or that?</p>
  <p> When you follow those 'hunches,' they usually pay off.</p>
  <p> Sometimes though, you don't follow your hunches and later you wish that you had.</p>
  <p> This process of listening to and following your hunches simply amounts to capitalizing on the preconscious thought processes that comprise your intuitive level of thinking.</p>
  <p> With practice, you can learn the technique of becoming aware of these subtleties and utilizing these fleeting moments of insight and intuition.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, practice during the day being still for a few minutes at a time.</p>
  <p> Suspend your thinking processes and simply 'drink in' your surroundings without evaluating anything.</p>
  <p> Close your eyes and just listen to your internal voice.</p>
  <p> Ask a question, pose a problem or express a desire; then listen for a subconscious answer.</p>
  <p> Be patient with yourself.</p>
  <p> This is not something you can force or get emotional about.</p>
  <p> Calmly think and calmly feel everything.</p>
  <p> Never be skeptical; never be excited or emotional.</p>
  <p> Just allow your intuition to express itself.</p>
  <p> Practice with some low-risk unimportant decisions at first to get yourself used to reaching that part of your mind, but practice.</p>
  <p> Occasionally guess who it is when the phone rings, or who is going to win a ball game that means little to you, or whether the stock market will go up or down for the day, etc.</p>
  <p> Keep track of your results by writing down your daily scores in a diary.</p>
  <p> Many people make wrong investments because their thinking is distorted by greed, instead of being scientifically guided by intuition.</p>
  <p> If you don't allow your emotions to cloud the issue, your intuition should grow stronger and more accurate.</p>
  <p> Above all, keep an open and positively receptive attitude toward the process.</p>
  <p> The feeling after or during deep meditation that gives you a peaceful, calm and happy feeling is the state of intuition.</p>
  <p> Exercise and be aware of this powerful state on a daily basis.</p>
  <p> Sometimes you may have a momentary flash of insight during the day, and without even trying to do anything you will have a foretelling vision of future events!</p>
  <p> The more you tune into your intuition, the easier the process becomes.</p>
  <p> Eventually you will learn to rely more and more on your intuition before making any important business, social or spiritual decisions.</p>
