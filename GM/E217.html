  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 217 </p><h1>Body Rhythms and Cycles (Chronobiology)</h1>
  <p> The study of biological rhythms and cycles is called chronobiology.</p>
  <p> Each one of your body's rhythms has its own timing.</p>
  <p> There are cycles governing body temperature, blood pressure, hormone levels, iron concentration in the bloodstream, heart rate, memory, mathematical acuity, sexual appetite, blood sugar levels, sleep, white blood cell count, hand strength, sensitivity to pain, eye-hand coordination, etc.</p>
  <p> Your subconscious mind interrelates your body rhythms and energies with your environment to bring about your ailments, accidents and stressful situations.</p>
  <p> You are not an innocent victim of daily events and circumstances.</p>
  <p> You create them!</p>
  <p> In many instances, this process occurs during 37-hour cycles -- beginning with negative, emotional repression and ending with ailments or mishaps.</p>
  <p> For example, think back to when you last got a cold.</p>
  <p> Did something 37 hours prior to catching your cold emotionally upset you?</p>
  <p> Strong emotion sets the body clock into motion.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, keep a diary and record the exact hour that you next "blow off steam," and be careful with your activities 37 hours later.</p>
  <p> Also, reverse the process.</p>
  <p> Meditate or create a joyful, loving atmosphere about yourself 37 hours prior to an important meeting or event in your life and notice how well things go for you.</p>
  <p> Like the surface of the earth, man is 80% water and 20% solids (salinity and minerals in the blood and body tissues are also similar to the oceans).</p>
  <p> The moon affects your fluids in a gravitational way like the oceans of the world.</p>
  <p> At a new and full moon, tides are at their highest and the moon's effect is at its strongest on your behavior.</p>
  <p> Violent crime, fires and accidents are at their highest.</p>
  <p> Psychiatric ward attendants know that at a full moon, mental patients evidence increased, aberrant behavior.</p>
  <p> A massive disturbance in gravity due to the 29.5-day lunar cycle brings about mood shifts -- especially with those people least in control of their conscious lives.</p>
  <p> Telepathic abilities of people also increase during a full moon.</p>
  <p> Gross electromagnetic forces originating with celestial bodies affect the electromagnetic fields around and through your body -- right down to the tiniest cell.</p>
  <p> For instance, when the sun reverses its polarity every 11.5 years (north to south), there is a high incidence of sun spots.</p>
  <p> The resulting electromagnetic fluctuations bring about weather changes, radio transmission disruptions and anxiety manifestations in many people.</p>
  <p> Remember though, whenever external conditions disrupt your body's rhythms, conscious directives can adjust them.</p>
  <p> You have just as much control over your body as you think you have, so begin exercising that control.</p>
  <p> Normal body temperature is 98.6°F, but there is a 2° variation throughout the day.</p>
  <p> Take your body temperature every hour during the day and determine when your temperature is the highest.</p>
  <p> Your physical activities are performed their best when your temperature is the highest.</p>
  <p> For instance, in track events the winner always has the highest temperature.</p>
  <p> (Could adjusting the body temperature before a race improve performance?)</p>
  <p> Your mind is also more alert at higher temperatures and performs faster, but there are more mistakes too.</p>
  <p> (Could telepathic or psychokinetic abilities be amplified with higher body temperatures?)</p>
  <p> While chronobiology is being studied, implementation of research results are slow in being accepted.</p>
  <p> Should the body rhythms of surgeons as well as the patients be considered before operations?</p>
  <p> Should traffic control operators, pilots and other people responsible for hundreds of lives be evaluated chronobiologically for optimal efficiency?</p>
  <p> Perhaps one day, working with your body rhythms will be commonplace in maximizing your efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
