  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 167 </p><h1>Lucid Dreaming: Conscious Awareness of Your Dreams</h1>
  <p> One essential phase of sleep called the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phase is where most dreams occur.</p>
  <p> Humans and lab animals that have been deprived of REM sleep exhibit bizarre and often psychotic behavior.</p>
  <p> Researchers have found that your REM dream state is predominantly the alpha and theta brainwave states (4 to 7 cycles per second and 7 to 14 cycles per second respectively).</p>
  <p> Dreams are ordinarily spontaneous and representative of subconscious meanderings.</p>
  <p> They can also be a psychological release of tension.</p>
  <p> As far back as Biblical times, dreams have symbolically carried meaning (" and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh." Gen. 41:8).</p>
  <p> Since dreams are often veiled in symbolism, it's important to record your dreams and periodically review them to acquaint yourself with any interpretive parallels happening in your life.</p>
  <p> After interpreting your own subconscious symbolism, dreams can open themselves up to a personal enjoyment instead of a perplexing experience.</p>
  <p> The term lucid dreaming describes the experience of consciously recognizing during a dream that you are dreaming.</p>
  <p> By involving your conscious awareness in a subconscious activity, you can learn to control the content of your dream and its course of action.</p>
  <p> The more mindful and fully conscious you are in your normal waking state, the easier it will be for you to master the lucid dreaming state.</p>
  <p> Review “<a href="HS/E119.html">Exercise 119 - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness</a>” to sharpen your lucid dreaming state.</p>
  <p> Dreams to a lucid dreamer are more vivid than simple visualizations.</p>
  <p> Objects and people appear to be and feel solid, and the dreamer is often able to converse intelligently with his own dream characters.</p>
  <p> Lucid dreamers can create or eliminate characters and items within the dream by simply wanting to do so.</p>
  <p> In dreams, you can even levitate or fly.</p>
  <p> So if you're ever in doubt of your dream state, try flying as a test.</p>
  <p> A Malaysian tribe called the Senoi revolves much of its culture around dreams.</p>
  <p> At an early age, parents question their children closely about their dreams.</p>
  <p> The children are taught early how to control their dreams and to bring about beneficial outcomes.</p>
  <p> By consciously manipulating their subconscious dreams, the Senoi manifest positive results in the waking world and resolve their daily problems more readily.</p>
  <p> One technique to achieving a lucid dream state is to ask yourself the question, "Is this a dream?\"or "Am I dreaming?" 10 to 20 times just before falling asleep.</p>
  <p> The conscious repetitiveness of the question will eventually be submerged into the subconscious dream state.</p>
  <p> Reflecting cognitively upon such a question in the dream state will result in some form of conscious intervention and awareness, and hence a lucid dream state will be achieved.</p>
  <p> As a variation of the former method, simply count and affirm just before retiring, "I am dreaming, One" -- "I am dreaming, Two" and so on.</p>
  <p> Attending to the counting process keeps your conscious awareness vigilant to what you intend to do.</p>
  <p> For those people who tend to fall asleep rapidly, this method can have you counting straight into dreamland.</p>
  <p> Another method is to reiterate over and over to yourself just before going to sleep, "I am going to sleep now.</p>
  <p> I know that I will be dreaming.</p>
  <p> I will recognize that I am dreaming when I am dreaming.</p>
  <p> Tonight, I will be consciously aware of my dream.</p>
  <p> I will remember what I dream in full conscious detail."</p>
  <p> You can also use a stimulus response link.</p>
  <p> For instance just before going to sleep, look at your hand while reiterating to yourself over and over, "When I see my hand in my dream, I will know I am dreaming."</p>
  <p> One researcher used with great success a mild electric shock to signal subject dreamers they were dreaming.</p>
  <p> Any of these techniques may initiate a flood of colors, images, sounds and thoughts.</p>
  <p> If you begin thinking in abstract ways, it usually indicates the right brain is taking over and the left brain is becoming idle.</p>
  <p> Just continue observing and the sounds and images will eventually evolve into a 3-dimensional dream that you can consciously explore, change and learn from.</p>
  <p> For recurring nightmares or fearful dreams, intensely visualize yourself actively in a more preferred scenario just before falling asleep.</p>
  <p> Imagine yourself initiating actions in the manner that is most beneficial to you so that the stage is set for the subconscious to rerun the same play in your favor.</p>
  <p> Combine your visualization with the suggestion that you are in control of your dream and that there is nothing to fear.</p>
  <p> Eventually your imagery process will merge into a dream process and positive results will be achieved.</p>
  <p> Using the above techniques will produce an ability to achieve lucid dreaming in 4 to 5 weeks or less.</p>
  <p> After achieving a lucid dream state, act only as a casual observer at first or the condition might quickly dissipate into wakefulness.</p>
  <p> Slowly integrate into your dreams volitional control and alterations, and soon full dream mastery will be achieved.</p>
  <p> If you avoid whimsical notions, you can design purposeful meaning to your dreams and achieve in the dream state that which you want in the real world.</p>
  <p> If you want positive episodes to happen in the real world, you can now create dreams about them first.</p>
  <p> Since many remembered dreams are recollections of astral travel (esp.</p>
  <p> flying dreams), (review "<a href="GM/E184.html">Exercise 184 - Astral Projection Techniques</a>" and "<a href="GM/E185.html">Exercise 185 - Astral Projection Adventures</a>"), learning lucid dreaming can also be important in learning how to consciously remember and participate in astral journeys.</p>
  <p> There is a right to left brain shift during the night after 45 minutes; then a left to right shift after another 45 minutes.</p>
  <p> Consequently, every 90 minutes, there is a storm of neuronal activity in the right brain as it goes into its REM dream cycle for several minutes.</p>
  <p> Not surprisingly, the same brain cycle follows throughout the day as well.</p>
  <p> Ever notice how sometimes you're more prone to daydreaming while reading than at other times?</p>
  <p> Daydreaming often occurs spontaneously throughout the day and is also subconsciously oriented.</p>
  <p> This “in the back of the mind” imaging sometimes guides your thought patterns toward a preoccupation into negative thinking.</p>
  <p> Since daydreams are more easily interrupted, practice observing them when they occur.</p>
  <p> Then interject your conscious influence over the flow and outcome of the daydreams by directing them into a more positive result.</p>
  <p> If daydreams are too elusive to manage, begin with conjured up visualizations that you can create for yourself.</p>
  <p> Devise an imagined script and story and produce your own inner plays.</p>
  <p> You can also take advantage of the 45-minute brain shift cycle by practicing your visualization exercises during right brain period.</p>
  <p> Research has shown that lucid dreamers are more likely than non-lucid dreamers to have dreams that are positive, successful or filled with good fortune.</p>
  <p> It makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> If you can control the flow and outcome of your dream, why would you want a negative dream?</p>
