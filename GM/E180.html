  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 180 </p><h1>Mirror Regression or Fantasy</h1>
  <p> Depending upon your belief system, this exercise could be just a fanciful novelty or it could be a regressive look back into your previous lifetimes.</p>
  <p> Seat yourself, naked or clothed, in front of a large mirror in a darkened room with a small flickering candle on each side of you.</p>
  <p> Relax your body completely and breathe rhythmically and deeply into your abdomen.</p>
  <p> Now begin looking at your image in the mirror.</p>
  <p> Concentrate your attention intently upon your right eye without blinking and instruct yourself to progressively relax deeper and deeper (review "<a href="EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>").</p>
  <p> Now ask yourself softly, "Who have I been?"</p>
  <p> Keep breathing deeply and rhythmically while repeating the question over and over.</p>
  <p> Soon you will 'see' changes take place in your face and body.</p>
  <p> Different clothes, skin tone, hair length and even sex changes may become apparent.</p>
  <p> As your images come and go, stop from time to time and hold onto an image.</p>
  <p> Ask questions of it concerning your life and experiences, then move on to others.</p>
  <p> To conclude the session, simply say to yourself that you will count from 1 to 10 and at the number 10, you will be fully in the present, feeling wonderfully refreshed and full of energy.</p>
