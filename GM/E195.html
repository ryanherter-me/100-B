  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 195 </p><h1>Psychokinesis</h1>
  <p> Psychokinesis is controlling or changing a condition (apart from your own body) using only your mind, and there is far too much documented literature published of people who have witnessed psychokinetic feats to dismiss it summarily with disbelief!</p>
  <p> If you keep an open mind to everything in the world, you can learn.</p>
  <p> When you close your mind to anything, how can you learn?</p>
  <p> You've learned in other exercises how your thoughts alone can affect your bodily functions as well as those around you, but thoughts also have tangible effects on inanimate materials as well.</p>
  <p> All things in the universe are connected in some way.</p>
  <p> Think back to a time when your car developed 'troubles' or when your home appliances started going on the 'fritz.' Were you cursing your car or home?</p>
  <p> Were you going through a bout of depression, loneliness, anger or stress?</p>
  <p> Your thought energy has a ripple effect on the universe, and it is most magnified in your immediate surroundings.</p>
  <p> Negative thoughts produce a scattered, disorderly effect.</p>
  <p> Developing a psychokinetic ability is similar to other things in your life.</p>
  <p> You must have a desire to achieve it.</p>
  <p> You must believe it is possible for you to have it and you must expect to get it.</p>
  <p> After watching Uri Geller bend spoons and other metal objects on British TV, hundreds of onlookers wound up performing the same feats in their own homes!</p>
  <p> For this exercise, assume a comfortable, relaxed position in a chair (review "<a href="EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>" and "<a href="EM/E026.html">Exercise 26 - Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes</a>").</p>
  <p> Now slowly take several deep, abdominal breaths by inhaling to the count of 4, holding it to the count of 4, exhaling to the count of 4 and pausing to the count of 4.</p>
  <p> Take a spoon and hold it in one hand by grasping it in the crotch with your fingers.</p>
  <p> Hold it loosely, and with your thumb, gently stroke the middle part of the spoon.</p>
  <p> As you're stroking the spoon with your thumb, repeat to yourself inwardly the word -- BEND.</p>
  <p> You can pulse your commands in a rhythmic manner or in whatever way feels comfortable to you.</p>
  <p> While stroking the spoon and repeating the word bend, visualize the spoon in an already bent position or as limp as a wet noodle.</p>
  <p> Imagine a ball of white energy above the top of your head; then feel it vibrate and move down through your head and into your arms; and then through your fingertips into the spoon.</p>
  <p> Imagine a spiral or vortex of energy streaming from your eyes and into the spoon.</p>
  <p> When doing this technique, direct your total conscious awareness to the process.</p>
  <p> Being preoccupied by everyday emotional conflicts can prevent results.</p>
  <p> Blank your mind of any internal comments, evaluations or distractions.</p>
  <p> The more focalized your concentration, the faster the spoon will bend.</p>
  <p> Many times the spoon will bend at the thinnest part (although no significant temperature increase is noted), and sometimes it will simply soften to the point that a slight push with the thumb produces the bend.</p>
  <p> In the beginning, it might take you a while to achieve the task, but sometimes it happens rather quickly.</p>
  <p> After the first time though, subsequent bendings will take far less time, because your belief system will be stronger.</p>
  <p> About 10% to 20% of the people will succeed in spoon bending the first time out.</p>
  <p> A high percentage of children succeed in this because their belief system is less cluttered with doubts.</p>
  <p> The ages 7 to 11 are especially successful.</p>
  <p> Approach this exercise with a sense of fun and excitement.</p>
  <p> Don't use the word try.</p>
  <p> You either bend the spoon or you don't bend the spoon.</p>
  <p> If you don't at first, then do it the next time.</p>
  <p> Sometimes the spoon will begin bending on its own after you put it down.</p>
  <p> Sometimes it becomes unnaturally soft and can be twisted into abnormal shapes (perhaps there's a molecular or vibrational metal fatigue going on).</p>
  <p> Some people can bend spoons easily when alone, but not in the presence of doubters or TV cameras.</p>
  <p> Negative vibrations seem to affect the sensitivity of their results.</p>
  <p> One researcher enhanced his psychokinetic abilities with a pyramid fitted on his head.</p>
  <p> After the Soviet Nina Kulagina demonstrated how she moved objects psychokinetically, she reportedly lost several pounds and felt fatigued.</p>
  <p> A lot of energy was obviously expended during the process.</p>
  <p> Brain instruments reflect tremendous activity in the visual or rear area of Kulagina's cerebrum during psychokinetic sessions, and her heartbeat increases to 240 beats per minute.</p>
  <p> Findings are similar with others, and some people even suffer temporary blindness (rear area of the brain governs vision).</p>
  <p> Sometimes rubbing your hands together or on the tabletop is an element in getting started with an electrostatic charge, but being grounded also helps results!?</p>
  <p> Initially learning how to move objects psychokinetically involves a great deal of nervous, emotional energy, and instruments record electrostatic pulsations in the direction of the affected objects.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, your interest and belief structure is strengthened, and a relaxed thought energy mysteriously achieves the same thing without electrostatic assistance.</p>
  <p> Since positive emotions focus the energy flow, hold the objects beforehand and create enjoyable feelings about them.</p>
  <p> Doubt and not being able to trust yourself diffuses your energy and holds you back, so practice positively and you'll succeed.</p>
  <p> Since there is an energy that streams forth from your eyes (see "<a href="GM/E214.html">Exercise 214 - Psionic and Psychotronic Generators</a>"), moving objects that are already accumulators of pranic energy like paper cones is easy.</p>
  <p> Now you can move on to ping pong balls placed on a flat, level surface.</p>
  <p> Relax and fixate your gaze on the ball and create for yourself the intention for it to move.</p>
  <p> See it moving in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Give your undivided attention to it for 2 or 3 minutes, then stop and practice again later.</p>
  <p> Be patient with yourself and practice during various emotional moods (anger, joy, compassion, love, etc.) or while projecting different visualizations (a laser beam, a hammer, a puff of air or even a tone of the right frequency).</p>
  <p> With persistent practice, you'll eventually strike the right combination.</p>
  <p> Instead of moving ping pong balls, many people find great success in moving or dissipating clouds in the sky.</p>
  <p> Psychokinesis may be contrary to the current laws of physics as science knows them today, but what about the new laws to science of tomorrow?</p>
