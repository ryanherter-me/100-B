  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 190 </p><h1>Sensory Telepathy</h1>
  <p> In an experiment with married couples, wives were hooked up to measure their galvanic skin response to stress while their husbands in a nearby room were shown photographs that included some pictures of ex-girlfriends.</p>
  <p> Whenever a husband looked at a former love, his wife was consciously unaware of it, but her subconscious reacted to it and registered a change on the instrument graph.</p>
  <p> In a similar experiment, husbands in another room plunged their feet into buckets of ice water.</p>
  <p> Even though their wives were unaware of their ordeal in the next room, instruments registered a greater variant response than with those wives whose husbands had no such stress subjected to them.</p>
  <p> On a subliminal or subconscious level, they were picking up the reactions of their spouses.</p>
  <p> Some of the best success ratios in telepathic reception have resulted when the perceivers "locked" in on the emotional frequency generated by the transmitter.</p>
  <p> A message with strong emotional content has an increased amplitude.</p>
  <p> For instance, you can often 'sense' anger in a room after a violent argument.</p>
  <p> Similarly, emotional longing, love or an expectant attitude also gives amplitude to transmissions.</p>
  <p> Therefore it would be far more sensible to use picture cards that evoked strong emotion for ESP testing than simple symbol cards.</p>
  <p> Previous exercises have covered sight and sound telepathy.</p>
  <p> This exercise covers gustatory, olfactory, tactile and kinesthetic telepathic transmission.</p>
  <p> Using a partner of the opposite sex, assume a relaxed position facing each other.</p>
  <p> The sender focuses on an emotional feeling and holds onto that as a carrier wave.</p>
  <p> Experiment with positive and negative emotions and note the differences.</p>
  <p> Now visualize and transmit a certain taste -- sweetness of chocolate candy, sourness of a lemon, bitterness of strong, black coffee or the salty, crispiness of potato chips.</p>
  <p> Next, transmit a certain smell -- an odor of a septic tank, a fragrance of a certain flower, tobacco or herb.</p>
  <p> Next, transmit a particular tactile sensation -- being naked on an iceberg, handling a snake or a ball with sharp pins, being sat on by an elephant or petting a shaggy dog.</p>
  <p> And finally, transmit a kinesthetic feeling -- falling off a high building, being buried alive in a coffin, rowing a boat, doing a somersault or simply making love.</p>
  <p> Next have your partner go into another room or simply turn around so your back is towards your partner's.</p>
  <p> Now let your partner taste each of 4 glasses of water with salt, sugar, lemon juice and instant coffee individually prepared.</p>
  <p> As your partner sends the taste to you, have him combine it with an emotional feeling.</p>
  <p> Do the same with the tactile sensations of pinching, needle pricking, hair brushing, skin stroking, etc.</p>
  <p> Have your partner choose different odors and send them to you from herb, tobacco or spice bottles.</p>
  <p> As the receiver, open up your senses in a fully associated way when you tune into your partner.</p>
