  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 175 </p><h1>Mental Subtraction</h1>
  <p> As with mental addition, mental subtraction can be done from left to right too.</p>
  <p> Whereas the main problem in normal addition is the need to carry numbers, in subtraction it is borrowing.</p>
  <p> With the following problems, there is no borrowing necessary.</p>
  <p> So practice subtracting these by proceeding from left to right: 96 74 97 49 86794 74698765 - 13 - 61 - 56 - 27 - 23581 - 63482514 Now practice from left to right with the following, but when you need to borrow a number (like subtracting 9 from 5) change to 5 to 15 and subtract the 9.</p>
  <p> After writing the answer down (6), put a slash through the number preceding it.</p>
  <p> The slash through the number indicates that it is to be read as if it were actually one number less than what it says.</p>
  <p> For example: 957 8845 7523 8247 3487 7834 9347 - 393 - 4294 - 4419 - 6158 - 4193 - 6956 - 1959 664 Practice until it becomes natural to pair and slash, and soon you'll be able to see the entire process in your mind as well.</p>
