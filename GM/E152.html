  <title>Shifting Your Conscious Awareness</title>

  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 152 </p><h1>Shifting Your Conscious Awareness</h1>
  <p> By shifting your conscious awareness to one of your arms and holding it there, you can increase the blood volume and pulse in that arm (review "<a href="/HS/E107.html">Exercise 107 - Electromagnetic Field Awareness</a>s").</p>
  <p> By shifting your conscious awareness to the tasting areas of your mouth and tongue, you can increase the saliva flow.</p>
  <p> By shifting your conscious awareness to a headache area, and questioning yourself about it (the opposite is what you normally do), you dilate the blood vessels in that area and relieve the vascular constriction causing the so-called headache (review "<a href="/GM/E149.html">Exercise 149 - Headache Relief</a>").</p>
  <p> Conversely, if you have a minor cut and shift your conscious awareness away from the wound, you help to constrict the blood flow.</p>
  <p> One Israeli researcher, Ilan Shalif, Ph.D., has found that holding your focus on an ailing part of the body for several minutes each day will bring the bodyâ€™s defenses to the area to repair it!</p>
  <p> These are all physiological effects brought about by shifting your conscious awareness.</p>
  <p> Now how about psychological effects?</p>
  <p> The next time you are fearful, sad, lonely, horny, angry, depressed or even hungry, shift your conscious awareness into the gut urge or negative emotion.</p>
  <p> When you do this, attempt to understand your feeling with the logical, conscious side of the brain.</p>
  <p> By holding your conscious attention to it (questioning, examining, etc.), a shift is often accomplished and your conscious input allows the gut urge or negative emotion to dissipate.</p>
  <p> When you get very good at this, your conscious side of the brain will no longer be overridden by your subconscious urges.</p>
  <p> You will have volitional control over experiencing or not experiencing any feeling you choose.</p>
  <p> Your conscious mind will do the choosing, because IT will be in control.</p>
  <p> It is interesting to note that when you experience love (not lust), friendliness or joy, shifting your conscious awareness into the emotion only intensifies the experience and the positive feeling does NOT dissipate.</p>
  <p> Since most people run primarily on a subconscious awareness during the day, they are constantly susceptible to the suggestive influences of others.</p>
  <p> Consequently, high pressure salesmen, loud preachers, politicians and emotional or sensory oriented advertisements on TV (with a 10 - 20% increase in sound volume) all have a convincing effect on the subconscious person.</p>
  <p> To demonstrate how you can shift someone's conscious awareness for him (as magicians do in the art of distraction), do the following pattern interrupt experiment.</p>
  <p> If someone is inundating you with negative communication, you can interrupt the other person's behavioral pattern by:</p>
  <p> 1) interrupting his (her) story with a more positive remark or even an unrelated comment.</p>
  <p> 2) offering a handshake, then quickly withdrawing your hand.</p>
  <p> 3) staring up suddenly at something in the air.</p>
  <p> 4) halting abruptly if walking in rhythm with someone.</p>
  <p> If your action is chosen carefully enough not to break the rapport, the pattern interrupt tends to achieve momentary confusion and/or temporary amnesia in the other person.</p>
  <p> At this point, the person also becomes susceptible to suggestion.</p>
  <p> Implanting positive suggestions at this point can achieve the other person's compliance because he (she) wants to trade confusion for clarity and will go along with your clarity for a short time at least.</p>
  <p> You can implant a suggestion into the mind of a subconsciously oriented person, if you choose the right moment.</p>
  <p> For instance, ask someone a question, and as he is listening to where your question is going and trying to formulate a response, there is a transitional lapse of time in his cognitive thinking process.</p>
  <p> During this instant of being blank, lightly slap him on the shoulder or shout at him (an unexpected event that shifts his conscious awareness) and implant the suggestion that he forgot his answer.</p>
  <p> Then after he stutters and stammers for several seconds, snap your fingers and suggest that now he remembers, and he will.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, flash your conscious awareness into and out of physiological areas for more conscious control over those areas.</p>
  <p> (Sometimes touching the area with your fingers helps to locate the area for you.</p>
  <p>) Use the power of visualization in conjunction with this process.</p>
  <p> For instance, do you have an upset stomach?</p>
  <p> Flash your conscious awareness right into the upset condition and become aware of the churning mixture of junk in the stomach.</p>
  <p> To relieve it, either throw it up from your mouth or visualize the lower stomach valve opening up and letting the stuff vent the stomach.</p>
  <p> (The sick feeling is brought about by its retention in the stomach.</p>
  <p>) By being consciously aware of this process and visualizing it, the body will respond.</p>
  <p> During the day, when a negative emotion pops up, shift your conscious awareness into it for more control and hold it there.</p>
  <p> Examine the emotion.</p>
  <p> Do you want it?</p>
  <p> Is it good for you?</p>
  <p> What physiologically is happening to you because of it?</p>
  <p> Keep consciously examining and questioning yourself about it and you trick the emotional side of the mind into releasing its control.</p>
  <p> It has to yield to the logical side of the mind if you WILL your conscious awareness into the experience (review "<a href="/EM/E015.html">Exercise 15 - Consciously Disciplining Yourself</a>").</p>
  <p> Isn't it interesting to have more control over your life?</p>
  <p> You're beginning to know yourself better now, aren't you?</p>
