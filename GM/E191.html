  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 191 </p><h1>Group Telepathy</h1>
  <p> When strong emotions are telepathically transmitted to people, consciously they often go unnoticed.</p>
  <p> Subconsciously though, these telepathic energies ARE received by recipients on a subtle level, as evidenced by measurable blood volume changes in their hands.</p>
  <p> Experiments reveal that these same physiological changes (registered on instrumentation) occur regardless of the distance between the sender and the receiver.</p>
  <p> When two or more people concentrate in unison, the effect is magnified geometrically (not 1 + 1 , but 1 x 10 ).</p>
  <p> Mob psychology or group hysteria is a good illustration in panic situations what can be easily "felt" by all who are present.</p>
  <p> People at a sporting event, rock concert or public demonstration easily get caught up in the "electricity" or "atmosphere" of the gathering.</p>
  <p> One Soviet experiment involved group telepathy in a boxing match.</p>
  <p> Five trained telepaths beamed losing thoughts to the champion while another five telepaths beamed winning thoughts to the underdog.</p>
  <p> The underdog won easily.</p>
  <p> Review "<a href="GM/E189.html">Exercise 189 - Audio Telepathy</a>," "<a href="GM/E188.html">Exercise 188 - Visual Telepathy</a>" and "<a href="GM/E190.html">Exercise 190 - Sensory Telepathy</a>."</p>
  <p> Perform these exercises with a group of senders and one receiver; then a group of receivers and one sender.</p>
  <p> Show a group of senders a horrible scene of death to transmit to a receiver in another room, then have them transmit a beautiful picture of birth.</p>
  <p> Experiment and choose other emotion-evoking scenes, but practice.</p>
