  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 149 </p><h1>Headache Relief</h1>
  <p> To begin with, stop affirming your so-called headache is a headache.</p>
  <p> Call it a socalled headache.</p>
  <p> This initiates doubt for the subconscious that the pain is even really there.</p>
  <p> Next, query yourself about it.</p>
  <p> How big is it?</p>
  <p> The size of a marble, golf ball or soft ball?</p>
  <p> Does it throb?</p>
  <p> Is the pain sharp or dull?</p>
  <p> Point to where in your head you feel it, and bring your conscious awareness to the area.</p>
  <p> Is it surface oriented or subsurface oriented?</p>
  <p> Is it long or short?</p>
  <p> Picture in your mind its appearance.</p>
  <p> Does it have a color?</p>
  <p> Is it hollow or solid?</p>
  <p> Let your answers be what first comes to your mind.</p>
  <p> Where is the so-called headache now?</p>
  <p> Continue visualizing and describing the so-called headache until it vanishes.</p>
  <p> Preoccupation with these mental questions and answers takes the mind off the tension which brought about your head pain.</p>
  <p> Whether it is vasodilation or vasoconstriction of the cranial blood vessels, just shifting your conscious awareness to the pain area brings about a more normalized blood flow, and touching the spot helps to orient your conscious awareness as to its location.</p>
