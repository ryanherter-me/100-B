  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 194 </p><h1>Psychometry</h1>
  <p> Psychometry is the art of deciphering the personal vibrations emanating from objects with your sense of touch.</p>
  <p> You might determine its origin, events occurring to it, who owned it and even the owner's state of mind.</p>
  <p> Now enlist the assistance of an enthusiastic or sympathetic friend, one that wants the success of the experiment.</p>
  <p> Let him take a pebble and wash it with soap and water as well as wash his own hands.</p>
  <p> Now let him dry his hands as well as the stone.</p>
  <p> Ask him to hold the stone in his left hand and think strongly about one thing for about a minute.</p>
  <p> It can be a color, a feeling or an object -- just so he devotes his time thinking only of it and nothing else.</p>
  <p> Next, have him temporarily put the pebble in a paper bag.</p>
  <p> Now wash and dry your own hands and lie down and get comfortable.</p>
  <p> Take the stone out of the bag with your left hand and hold it in your palm.</p>
  <p> Let your mind go blank.</p>
  <p> Soon you will get an impression, and with practice it will become more and more accurate.</p>
  <p> Eventually you will be able to pick up a letter (even in a foreign language) and tell about its contents without opening it (review "<a href="GM/E198.html">Exercise 198 - Understanding Any Spoken Language</a>").</p>
  <p> One cautioning note, never use your power to take money from other people.</p>
  <p> So-called "psychics" that take money for their "services" usually have little service to give.</p>
  <p> Their "powers" cannot be switched on at will and whatever "powers" they did have are usually lost rather quickly when they give into selfish gains.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise and do good for those around you in a selfless way and never brag about the power you have.</p>
  <p> Then you'll be more likely to keep it.</p>
  <p> There are universal laws and vibrations that govern us.</p>
  <p> Using your higher skills for selfish gains creates a lower vibration around you, and you quickly get out of 'synch,' causing your power to dissipate.</p>
