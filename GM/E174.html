  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 174 </p><h1>Mental Addition</h1>
  <p> Can a normal person with a good memory and a liking for numbers be taught to become a mental calculating wizard?</p>
  <p> Yes, in fact, in a month or two of consistent training, a person could appear to be a calculating prodigy.</p>
  <p> As with most things, practice is extremely important.</p>
  <p> Most lightning calculators "play" with numbers day and night, and they delight in finding new ways that certain numbers relate to each other.</p>
  <p> Numbers are their language, and they create harmonies with them in their minds.</p>
  <p> For centuries there have been exceptional examples of human calculators.</p>
  <p> Studies of lightning mental calculators have revealed that they primarily are either visualizers or auditory-rhythmic types (kinesthetic types have not yet been recognized).</p>
  <p> Long tables of squares, cubes, logarithms and countless other numerical facts are stored in the subconscious memories of human calculators along with hundreds of shortcut procedures in calculation.</p>
  <p> Some seem to develop their skill at an early age and have a natural flair for calculating.</p>
  <p> For instance, at the age of 3, Carl Friedrich Gauss looked at his father's weekly payroll for his laborers and said "Father, the reckoning is wrong " The child's solution turned out to be right and yet no one had taught him arithmetic!</p>
  <p> Practicing preliminary basics acquaints the mind to the shortcut techniques that eventually become automatic when the right brain takes over.</p>
  <p> It's like passing a critical threshold and suddenly a shift takes place.</p>
  <p> The calculating process is so fast that it becomes hard for the conscious mind to explain the process to a listener.</p>
  <p> To add columns of figures more rapidly, start pairing your numbers so that you think of 2 digits as one.</p>
  <p> For example: Don't add, just practice pairing the following addition columns: 7 1 3 8 5 6 4 2 9 > 10 3 5 6 3 9 4 2 9 8 4 > 13 9 4 8 1 3 8 9 4 6 8 > 17 9 9 7 2 5 7 6 2 7 26 (26) Practice pairing until it becomes automatic.</p>
  <p> Now design single columns of numbers and as fast as you can, add them up running your finger down the columns.</p>
  <p> Doing the following problem with the old-fashioned method, from right to left, you find that the 9 and 1 add to 10, leaving you with 1 to carry.</p>
  <p> If you go from left to right by pairing, you get a 7 and a 10.</p>
  <p> When the sum of a column of figures has more than one digit, simply add the 10's digit to the preceding column.</p>
  <p> In our example, since 9 + 1 is 10, you simply add the 10's digit to 5 + 2 to make 8; thus 80 is the answer.</p>
  <p> 59 + 21 The simplicity of this left to right process will reveal itself with practice.</p>
  <p> Now pair the following: 49 73 62 84 28 57 84 15 61 43 25 + 23 + 19 + 29 + 18 + 49 + 43 + 17 + 89 + 39 + 29 + 47 Now do some other examples in your mind and see how much easier it feels.</p>
