  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 210 </p><h1>Reading Body Language</h1>
  <p> As an exercise, at a party or with a prearranged group of people that agree to participate, have everyone for one half hour say nothing and communicate with body language alone.</p>
  <p> Observe in yourself and others what gestures and mannerisms are engaged in most frequently.</p>
  <p> Are facial expressions and hand gestures used more than body movements and touching?</p>
  <p> By innuendo and subtlety, do you begin to sense a bit of telepathy?</p>
  <p> Are emotional messages easier to transmit than non-emotional ones?</p>
  <p> Do you think you understand others and are being understood by others with more clarity or less clarity than with words?</p>
  <p> Do this same exercise with a friend or spouse for one half hour.</p>
  <p> Review the same points and questions as above.</p>
  <p> By relying solely on body language and non-verbal cues and messages, you become far more in tune with your own expressive abilities and how other people signal their attitudes as well.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise a lot.</p>
  <p> As a variation to this exercise, at a party or in a group situation, pair off with either someone you intuitively think you're going to like OR dislike -- not someone you're ambivalent towards.</p>
  <p> Go over all the same items as before and see how well you communicate.</p>
  <p> Reading body language can be improved by everyone with practice, so practice whenever you can.</p>
  <p> Observe people in airports, on buses or in crowds, and figure out what their body language and mannerisms are indicating.</p>
  <p> This simple exercise will also improve your powers of concentration and observation as well.</p>
