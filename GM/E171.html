  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 171 </p><h1>Lightning Calculating</h1>
  <p> Mathematics has often been likened to a language.</p>
  <p> Idiot savants (often left-brain impaired) occasionally take to lightning calculating naturally with no formal training in mathematics at all.</p>
  <p> Your left brain hemisphere processes information sequentially (one part after another).</p>
  <p> Your right hemisphere uses simultaneous processing.</p>
  <p> During World War II, plane spotters were trained to count at a glance not only the number of planes that were passing by, but by their silhouettes alone, how many of each type!</p>
  <p> They didn't count 1, 2, 3, 4 or 3, 6, 9, 12, but they acknowledged them all as a group!</p>
  <p> Small children learn to count this way very easily, that is before they are discouraged from doing so.</p>
  <p> This right brain faculty is also demonstrated when carpenters size a board without using a ruler or mechanics assess a certain size wrench for a particular bolt just by looking at it.</p>
  <p> To initiate the right brain's innate ability to calculate instantaneously, count your footsteps from 1 to 100 rhythmically as you walk or run, and observe simultaneously the sights and sounds with your 'conscious awareness' while still automatically counting.</p>
  <p> When you reach 100, start all over again.</p>
  <p> When the process becomes automatic, this simple drill can be expanded to reciting the 2's table -- until that too becomes automatic.</p>
  <p> While taking a walk, estimate the number of strides that it will take to reach a certain street, tree or corner.</p>
  <p> Count the steps and check yourself.</p>
  <p> Look at a building and guess the number of floors or windows it contains.</p>
  <p> Count and verify.</p>
  <p> When you get on a bus, flash to yourself the number of people already on board, then count to double check.</p>
  <p> Look at a parking lot and guesstimate the number of autos.</p>
  <p> In your home, count the number of tiles on a wall or the number of boards in the ceiling or the number of books on a shelf -- but always at a glance, then check yourself.</p>
  <p> Open a book and glance at a particular paragraph, then close your eyes and relate the number of lines in the paragraph.</p>
  <p> With enough practice, you'll eventually be able to look at a flock of birds and instantly give the number.</p>
  <p> As a further drill, take a few dominoes and glance at them giving the total number of spots instantly.</p>
  <p> With each day of progression, add more dominoes.</p>
  <p> In lieu of dominoes, practice with a small handful of peas or beans thrown on the table, each time varying the number.</p>
  <p> With 15-30 minutes of practice per day, in a week you'll suddenly be counting instantaneously and amazing yourself.</p>
  <p> For another drill, estimate the length, width and thickness of a board from a 4-foot distance and then again from a 20-foot distance.</p>
  <p> Estimate the height and weight of a person the same way.</p>
  <p> Carnival show men do it.</p>
  <p> So can you!</p>
  <p> For the auditory minded, practice with a tape recorder and a friend.</p>
  <p> Have the friend prearrange a series of calculations on paper to be read into the tape recorder for playback by you later.</p>
  <p> For instance, have him read at a certain tempo 40 x 3 + 20 รท 7 รท 5 x 4 x 3 รท 12 = ?</p>
  <p> Design your own variety of problems with varying complexity and press yourself for speed by having the tempo increased progressively.</p>
  <p> With practice, you'll find a 'letting go' procedure takes place and the answer just pops up!</p>
  <p> It might also help to disengage the left brain from participating in the calculations, so say the ABC's while mentally doing each mathematical problem.</p>
  <p> As another drill, have a friend read words to you from a book and you give the number of letters in them.</p>
  <p> The left brain is comfortable with counting by 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's and even by 7-item groupings before it has to slide over to the right brain for assistance in higher numbers.</p>
  <p> To acquaint your brain's acknowledgement of number groupings, practice with the following for 1 second glances: After completing the above, take a 1" x 1" window square cut out from a piece of paper and slide it over the dots below.</p>
  <p> Determine the number of each random dot grouping within the window as quickly as possible; then confirm your count.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, do the same thing with a 2" x 2" window square.</p>
  <p> To determine the dots more effectively, flash your focus over the dots in a series of saccadic jumps.</p>
  <p> Also to disengage your left brain counting tendency, say the ABC's simultaneously to yourself while you do this flash counting in your right field of vision.</p>
