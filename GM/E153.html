  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 153 </p><h1>Pain Control Via Detachment</h1>
  <p> When Jack Schwarz sticks a long sailor's needle through his bicep, he feels no pain, does not bleed and has no infection.</p>
  <p> Why?</p>
  <p> He uses a detachment visualization technique.</p>
  <p> It is not HIS arm attached to HIS body, but instead it is AN arm away from his body and therefore no feeling is possible.</p>
  <p> Amputees sometimes suffer from the phantom limb 'itch' where they feel an itch on a limb that does not exist.</p>
  <p> Now stand in a comfortable, relaxed position with your eyes closed.</p>
  <p> Do some steady abdominal breathing for a couple minutes and assume a balanced position.</p>
  <p> Now become aware of your left arm and raise it over your head.</p>
  <p> Feel the muscles flex as you stretch it all the way to your fingertips.</p>
  <p> Bring your conscious awareness to each set of muscles in your hand, arm and shoulder and feel the way they move.</p>
  <p> Now lower your arm.</p>
  <p> Now raise your imaginary or mental left arm, and flex and stretch it the same way.</p>
  <p> Feel the muscles move as if it were your real arm.</p>
  <p> Alternate flexing your real arm and then your mental arm several times.</p>
  <p> Do the same thing with your right arm, experiencing as much feeling in your mental arm as possible.</p>
  <p> Alternate several times.</p>
  <p> Now extend both real arms out from your sides and rotate them in circles, then reverse the direction.</p>
  <p> Make the circles bigger.</p>
  <p> Do the same thing with your mental arms.</p>
  <p> Alternate back to your real arms, then your mental arms again.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Now bend down to touch your toes with your real fingers and be aware of how the process feels.</p>
  <p> Return to the standing position again.</p>
  <p> Now bend down with your mental body to touch your toes.</p>
  <p> Feel the same process take place with your mental muscles.</p>
  <p> Come back.</p>
  <p> Now alternate to the real body, then again to the mental body.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Now put your hands on your hips and rotate your torso to the left and then back again.</p>
  <p> Do the same with your mental body.</p>
  <p> Now swivel your torso to the right and then back.</p>
  <p> Do the same with your mental body.</p>
  <p> Now rotate your real torso to the left while swiveling your mental torso to the right.</p>
  <p> Come back to rest.</p>
  <p> Now turn your real body to the right and your mental body to the left.</p>
  <p> Come back.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Now, extend your real arms straight out to the sides.</p>
  <p> Simultaneously imagine your mental arms hanging at your sides.</p>
  <p> Now slowly raise your mental arms as you lower your real arms so that they switch positions.</p>
  <p> Put your conscious awareness into the process and feel the transposition taking place.</p>
  <p> Now reverse it.</p>
  <p> Lower your mental arms and raise your real arms.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Now with your real body, hop into the spot on the floor one foot in front of you.</p>
  <p> Now hop backwards to your original spot.</p>
  <p> Now let your mental body hop into the same spot in front of you.</p>
  <p> Now hop back again.</p>
  <p> Repeat the process with real and mental bodies several times.</p>
  <p> Now jump forward with your mental body and remain there.</p>
  <p> Now jump with your real body into that same spot.</p>
  <p> Now hop backwards with your mental body, then let your real body hop backwards into your mental body.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Now hop with your mental body forwards and turn around to look at your physical body.</p>
  <p> You have now learned to detach your mental body totally away from your real body to act as a casual observer.</p>
  <p> This detachment visualization process brings about a 'realness' to the mental body that has to be experienced to be understood.</p>
  <p> If you ever find your attention wandering in this exercise, stop and practice another day, for total awareness and concentration is necessary to perfect this technique.</p>
  <p> In the end, you'll master this exercise and develop a non-attached point of view not hindered by fear or repressed emotions.</p>
