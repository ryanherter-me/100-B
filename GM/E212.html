  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 212 </p><h1>Functioning on Little or No ‘Sleep’ at All</h1>
  <p> How much sleep do we need?</p>
  <p> Thomas Edison slept only 4 hours per night, thus adding 10 more years to his wakeful life.</p>
  <p> On July 8, 1943, Senora Ines Fernandez, 57, started a sleepless period that lasted over 30 years!</p>
  <p> While standing at her cottage door in a town in southwest Spain, she watched a religious procession and suddenly felt a searing pain in her head.</p>
  <p> She never slept again!</p>
  <p> No pills or medicines worked and doctors determined that this total insomnia was a result of the impairment of the sleep center of the brain.</p>
  <p> There have been other cases like this on medical record, but the phenomenon is extremely rare.</p>
  <p> In all studied cases of little or no sleep, individuals engaged in brief periods of dreamy relaxation during the day or night to recharge their body and mind.</p>
  <p> Through research with "electrosleep" (artificially induced sleep via electrodes that pulse a mild electrical current into the brain), it was learned that total relaxation cuts the necessary sleeping time down considerably.</p>
  <p> Most people toss and turn throughout the night, relaxing one set of muscles then another, until all the body's muscles have eventually undergone some form of relaxation.</p>
  <p> Through electrosleep, all the muscles are relaxed without the tossing and turning, and 1 or 2 hours of relaxed sleep under the sleep machine is equivalent to 8 hours of normal rest.</p>
  <p> This exercise should only be done after mastering "<a href="GM/E176.html">Exercise 176 - Learning Self-Hypnosis</a>" or "<a href="GM/E177.html">Exercise 177 - Self-Induced Trance</a>," and it certainly should not be performed if there is a medical reason to discourage it.</p>
  <p> Also this exercise will only be of benefit to you if you have special reasons to utilize it.</p>
  <p> Since most people spend 1/3 of their life asleep, dynamic individuals have found that sleeping less has enabled them to accomplish more.</p>
  <p> To proceed with this exercise, assume a comfortable position and get into a selfinduced hypnotic state.</p>
  <p> While experiencing this relaxed state, repeat the following set of affirmations 3 times.</p>
  <p> "My body and mind are filling with renewed energy.</p>
  <p> I am feeling rested and refreshed.</p>
  <p> The deeper I relax, the less sleep I need.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise for 15 minutes 3 times a day.</p>
  <p> Within days, you will notice that you no longer desire as much sleep as you used to require.</p>
  <p> To rouse yourself back to a waking state, simply count slowly from 10 to 1 and progressively awaken yourself.</p>
  <p> At the count of one, open your eyes and say, "I am wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health.</p>
  <p> This exercise is especially useful when you drive long distances and start to feel drowsy.</p>
