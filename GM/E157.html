  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 157 </p><h1>Your “New Life” Mind Walk</h1>
  <p> Do you use your accumulated attributes and skills to your best advantage?</p>
  <p> Are you waiting for something to be "just right" before you take action toward an inner desire or goal that you've always had?</p>
  <p> Are past occurrences or grievances acting as stumbling blocks or excuses for your not taking action toward what you want in life?</p>
  <p> A key to real empowerment in your life revolves around your ability to start each day as a clean slate, without past occurrences, behavior or episodes interfering with your progress.</p>
  <p> If you embrace the possibility of living your life NOW without getting stuck in old, negative programming, you can live your life fully, powerfully and with a fresh perspective every day.</p>
  <p> Life is only as difficult or easy as you allow it to be.</p>
  <p> What is your No.</p>
  <p> 1 goal, ambition or direction in life?</p>
  <p> Jot down your goal in a notebook and make a plan or an outline on what you can do to take action toward it during the next year, during the next month, next week, tomorrow and even right now.</p>
  <p> Next, write down a paragraph describing how you see yourself 5, 10 and 20 years from now after having achieved your goal.</p>
  <p> Now look at what you're written and mind walk through your goal and successfully realize it.</p>
  <p> Every day spend 15 minutes writing down your goal again, reviewing your progress and visualizing having achieved your goal.</p>
  <p> Fully associate yourself with all the details of accomplishing your goal.</p>
  <p> Imagine the surroundings, see, hear and feel whatever it entails.</p>
  <p> Put into motion whatever it takes to work toward your goal.</p>
  <p> You'll find that once you begin integrating your actions toward your committed goal, synchronistic happenings will start falling your way to assist the process.</p>
  <p> Proceed without hesitation.</p>
  <p> Be bold, and make some progress every day toward the ultimate fulfillment of your goal.</p>
  <p> If you're having trouble creating such feelings, pretend you're someone who you know does have such feelings.</p>
  <p> The key to the process is to make the commitment and get off the fence of indecision; then move into action toward your goal.</p>
  <p> Proceed with your plan without worry, and just watch the process unfold for you.</p>
  <p> Don't get stopped or stalled with details, just figure everything out along the way while you're in motion.</p>
  <p> As an exercise before opening your eyes in the morning, affirm to yourself with conscious clarity what you are committed to accomplishing for the day toward your goal.</p>
  <p> Do this without referencing any past problems, excuses or reasons that might otherwise hinder your intentions.</p>
  <p> Understand that thoughts create your reality experiences, but you must act upon them.</p>
  <p> When you do act, you feel better about yourself and happier through a sincere sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <p> The possibilities open to you for your future are as limitless as your imagination.</p>
  <p> Now slowly open your eyes, stretch and feel good and assured that your goal will be realized.</p>
