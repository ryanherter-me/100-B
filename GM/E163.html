  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 163 </p><h1>Time Awareness</h1>
  <p> Some people have to be awakened with an alarm clock and others wake up when they want automatically.</p>
  <p> In order to do away with your outer alarm clock, you have to learn how to make use of your 'inner alarm clock.'</p>
  <p> As you relax in preparation for sleep, visualize the face of a clock.</p>
  <p> Mentally move the hands of the clock to one minute before your real alarm clock is scheduled to go off.</p>
  <p> After getting good at waking up at that time, you will have no need for physical alarm clocks.</p>
  <p> As a daily exercise, look at your watch, then for the next hour, periodically guesstimate the time, then afterwards confirm.</p>
  <p> Then, at odd hours during the day, catch yourself before you look at your watch and guesstimate the time, then check your watch to confirm.</p>
  <p> With enough practice, there is a certain 'knowingness' that allows you to accurately perform in this manner.</p>
