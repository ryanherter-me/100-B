  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 207 </p><h1>Learning Observational Subtleties</h1>
  <p> Magicians rely on distraction and taking your conscious attention away from the observational subtleties that would otherwise reveal their tricks.</p>
  <p> For instance, a popular party trick involves apparent 'telepathy' with a partner.</p>
  <p> The audience chooses an object (size does not matter) in the room while you are out of the room.</p>
  <p> You return and with your back turned or blindfolded, your partner points to various objects in the room.</p>
  <p> He says, "Is this the object we chose?</p>
  <p> You say, "No," until he points to the target object and you say, "Yes.</p>
  <p> The trick can be done in various ways.</p>
  <p> Your partner and yourself can predesignate ahead of time that when the sixth object is pointed to -- it will be the correct one.</p>
  <p> You can vary it by coding the questioning to a different sentence when the correct one is pointed to.</p>
  <p> You can do it unblindfolded and agree with your partner ahead of time that the correct object will be after he points to a chair in the room or after he turns his pointing pencil around or after he points to something red in the room.</p>
  <p> Invent other cued variations between your partner and yourself.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, do this trick and let the group know that there is a subtlety that they are to pick up and repeat the trick the same way until they get it; or have each person write on a piece of paper what he thinks is the solution and silently review the papers to determine who got it.</p>
  <p> Then go to the next variation and proceed the same way.</p>
  <p> This exercise keys people into more attention to detail and increases the interest factor for more correct observational recall.</p>
