  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 221 </p><h1>Dispelling “Evil” From A Person</h1>
  <p> Studies of individuals who had 'multiple personalities' revealed that their brain wave patterns (via an electroencephalogram) were as different as between personalities of different individual people.</p>
  <p> Whereas normal subjects that tried to fake multiple personalities could not alter their brain wave patterns significantly.</p>
  <p> There are those of you that believe in demonic influences and those of you that do not.</p>
  <p> It doesn't matter, because this exercise is for either school of thought.</p>
  <p> If harmful, spirit entities draw to your negative, emotional behavior to accentuate or augment it, the reverse has got to repel them.</p>
  <p> "Resist not evil," simply means not to grapple or fight it in a resisting fashion.</p>
  <p> Instead embrace it in a loving fashion ("Love thy enemy").</p>
  <p> Pure, selfless, unqualified love is a powerful force.</p>
  <p> It has nothing to do with sex or lust, but everything to do with true power over evil.</p>
  <p> Most people rarely experience it.</p>
  <p> Think of a moment in your past when you came close to experiencing selfless love (parent for child, child for parent, spouse for spouse), and concentrate on that feeling.</p>
  <p> Now visualize a goblin-type entity called Mr.</p>
  <p> Fear around the person who appears to have a nasty, uncontrollable side to his personality.</p>
  <p> Visualize yourself alongside that person while you are generating unselfish love and both of you are seeking to embrace Mr.</p>
  <p> Fear.</p>
  <p> Visualize next either Mr.</p>
  <p> Fear running away or disintegrating in your embrace.</p>
  <p> Do this exercise at least 3 times a day and watch the effect that it has on the other person.</p>
  <p> Don't even let the other person know what you are doing.</p>
  <p> If you are a Christian, couple the visualization with an affirmation like, "In the Name of Jesus Christ, disperse all evil and fear in (your friend).</p>
  <p> If you are not a Christian, say, "All the fear in (your friend) is dispersing now.</p>
  <p> Either way, repeat the affirmation 3 times or more for maximum effect.</p>
