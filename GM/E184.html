  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 184 </p><h1>Astral Projection Techniques</h1>
  <p> The astral body and the physical body are connected together by a 'silver cord.'</p>
  <p> There also appears to be about a 3 ounce weight loss when the astral body leaves the physical body, according to the Monroe Institute.</p>
  <p> This indicates the astral body has a molecular mass.</p>
  <p> Surprising to Westerners is the fact that almost everyone's astral body leaves the physical body during sleep.</p>
  <p> Many of your dreams and nightmares come from experiences in the astral realm.</p>
  <p> Some people even experience 'out of the body' episodes when they have surgical operations under anesthesia.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, choose a time when you're completely alone.</p>
  <p> Lie down and relax in a comfortable position (review "<a href="EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>") and take 10 to 20 deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> Now while breathing slowly and with your eyes closed, imagine yourself in a room on the second floor of a house.</p>
  <p> There is a window in front of you.</p>
  <p> Go to the window and open it.</p>
  <p> Imagine yourself floating out of the window and looking down at the ground.</p>
  <p> Now float back into the room and over to your body lying on the bed.</p>
  <p> (You could also visualize the sensation of falling through the air once you're out of the window.)</p>
  <p> Hover over your body from 6 feet in the air and look down at yourself.</p>
  <p> Concentrate and feel your conscious awareness hovering at a point 6 feet above you.</p>
  <p> Imagine yourself very light and observing your own body features from 6 feet away (review "<a href="GM/E153.html">Exercise 153 - Pain Control Via Detachment</a>").</p>
  <p> Think and practice.</p>
  <p> With practice, you will suddenly experience a mild buzzing or almost an electric shock as the separation is made, but DON'T be afraid.</p>
  <p> Then suddenly you will 'see' your body lying with closed eyes some 6 feet beneath you.</p>
  <p> If you experience fear at this point, you will be 'reeled' back into your physical body immediately.</p>
  <p> Fear is a discordant vibration in the astral realm, so wait until another day to do the exercise again.</p>
  <p> Actually, astral travel is easy as long as you understand that you CAN do it.</p>
  <p> It may take days of practicing the technique, but you can do it.</p>
  <p> Here is another way of projecting your astral self from your physical body.</p>
  <p> Again, lie flat on your back in a relaxed, comfortable position and close your eyes.</p>
  <p> This time imagine a ghostly shape the size of your body slowly rising from your physical body and floating upwards like a puff of smoke.</p>
  <p> The first few times you do this, you may notice that you start twitching slightly or vibrating.</p>
  <p> This is good, because it means you are about to separate from your physical shell.</p>
  <p> Simply relax and let the separation take place.</p>
  <p> Let your astral body rise to within a few feet from your physical body.</p>
  <p> It will take practice, but if you continue to imagine that you can do it, you'll do it.</p>
  <p> To assist the process, you might repeat an affirmation ahead of time to alert the subconscious.</p>
  <p> For instance say, "I am projecting my astral body from my physical body."</p>
  <p> Say this affirmation 3 times in exactly the same way.</p>
  <p> Since you are always stating all kinds of things, an affirmation stated once does not alert the subconscious.</p>
  <p> If stated twice, the subconscious begins to take notice.</p>
  <p> Repeated the third time, the subconscious becomes receptively aware and records the affirmation for responsive use.</p>
  <p> You might want to experiment by giving yourself an affirmation before going to bed.</p>
  <p> You can say something like, “I will be fully conscious when my body falls asleep.</p>
  <p> I will be fully alert and will remember in full conscious detail what I am experiencing.</p>
  <p> I desire to go out of the body and explore this state with all my awareness.”</p>
  <p> You can say this affirmation to yourself 3 times, and then go to sleep.</p>
  <p> You can also affirm to yourself 3 times your desire to astrally visit and learn something specific from a distant library or country before retiring for the night.</p>
  <p> Some people also find it easier to travel astrally when they are uncomfortable -- cold, hungry or maybe with indigestion.</p>
  <p> Presumably the astral body becomes sick of being in the physical body.</p>
  <p> Drunkards suffering from delusions often slip out of the physical body and witness things they don't understand.</p>
  <p> Since alcohol is a poison and definitely destructive to the body, it is not recommended to get drunk to leave the body.</p>
  <p> (Caution: Astral projection should only be done by stable, well-balanced individuals.</p>
  <p> Since your astral body is your emotional body, unstable people should not dabble into things that could only confuse them even more.)</p>
