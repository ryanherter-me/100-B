  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 211 </p><h1>Reading People</h1>
  <p> Many people have great difficulty in reading other people, because they also have difficulty in reading themselves.</p>
  <p> These people often spend so much time covering up their own frailties with fa√ßades, internal blocks and verbal excuses that they often don't really bother getting to know others very well.</p>
  <p> All too often the non-thinking, emotional part of their brain expresses itself more frequently than the analytical, evaluating side of the brain.</p>
  <p> When such people do make an evaluation of another person, it often winds up being only an unconscious mirror version of what they have never admitted seeing in themselves.</p>
  <p> The more out of touch with yourself you are, the more inclined you are to produce a mirror reading of yourself for another person.</p>
  <p> When you learn to recognize undesirable emotional states in yourself, you're taking the 1st step toward changing these states.</p>
  <p> Reading other people accurately becomes easier for you then, because you act more like an observer.</p>
  <p> Now as an exercise,</p>
  <p> A) List 4 things in a notebook that would engulf you with compassion and love for your fellow man.</p>
  <p> B) List 4 things that would fill you with happiness, joy or contentment.</p>
  <p> C) List 4 things that would surge you with excitement.</p>
  <p> D) List 4 things that would flare you into anger.</p>
  <p> Misreading people and their intentions can often lead to trouble and great difficulty in your daily life.</p>
  <p> How you learn or don't learn from such difficulties can help OR hinder you later in life.</p>
  <p> Voice inflection, body mannerisms and eye expressions can be discerned subconsciously when you read people, or you can just as easily learn to read these signals consciously.</p>
  <p> For instance, great salespeople often observe carefully the body movements of potential customers.</p>
  <p> By mirroring and matching the body language and energy level of those they are about to sell to, good salespeople can thus establish a better buying receptivity in potential customers, because people generally feel more comfortable with other people that are like themselves.</p>
  <p> How well do you feel you know your friends and relatives?</p>
  <p> Do you feel you see them as they are or as they pretend to be or both?</p>
  <p> First of all, let's see how you see yourself.</p>
  <p> Now look at the words and phrases on the next page, and choose the appropriate words applicable for your own personality by putting a check mark beside them.</p>
  <p> If you photostat this sheet ahead of time and give it to your friends and relatives, you can see how you see each other.</p>
