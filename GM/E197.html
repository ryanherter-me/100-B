  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 197 </p><h1>Thinking As A Group</h1>
  <p> When the ancient Jews were bargaining with someone, they always stood or sat with their feet together and their hands clasped to effectively conserve the vital energy of their body.</p>
  <p> When the Jew bargained in this way and his opponent did not, the Jew had the advantage.</p>
  <p> Select a small group of unselfish, clear thinking people to accompany you for the following exercise.</p>
  <p> Let everyone sit in a circle with their feet together and their hands clasped.</p>
  <p> Each participant should be a separate physical unit, not touching one another.</p>
  <p> Positive, constructive thoughts have far more power than primitive, destructive thoughts.</p>
  <p> Choose an unselfish thought for the benefit of mankind that you all agree upon.</p>
  <p> Now sit in relaxed silence and think of that unselfish thought, while all of you gaze into the center of the circle at the space on the floor.</p>
  <p> You can use a candle as a focal point if you like, but it is not necessary for the effect.</p>
  <p> After several minutes, each of you will gradually feel a calm and peace permeate your very essence.</p>
  <p> You will feel as if you're being flooded with inner light and the spiritual feeling of being one with the universe will be more readily understood.</p>
  <p> Do this for at least 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
  <p> All pure thoughts that you generate in this way not only contribute to the welfare of the people around you, but to your own benefit as well.</p>
  <p> Even practicing by yourself in this way is highly beneficial.</p>
  <p> ("Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them " Matt.</p>
  <p> 18:19) So one person plus another person agreeing on the same thing is not 1 + 1 in amplitude, but like 10 x 1 in its effect.</p>
  <p> Since the group effect geometrically increases the amplitude of any focused attention, it can also be used in telepathy, psychokinesis and sending healing energy to someone at a distance.</p>
  <p> Multiply a negative vibration by thousands or millions of people and discordant 'auras' over cities, countries or even worlds can be perceived as they are approached from a distance.</p>
  <p> Focused, directed, positive energy from one or more people can change events and conditions because orderliness is more universally natural than disorderliness.</p>
  <p> Your energies are more in harmony with the universe when they are positive and focused.</p>
  <p> When you feel the universe as friendly, abundant and filled with joy and selfless love, you attract exactly that reality.</p>
  <p> As an example, in areas where large groups of peaceful meditators congregate, crime and traffic accidents drop significantly.</p>
  <p> Whether you engage in negativity or positivity, as ye sow, so shall ye reap.</p>
