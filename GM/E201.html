  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 201 </p><h1>Talking Fast</h1>
  <p> When you're emotionally angered, your continuity and logical flow of thoughts in speaking is greatly lessened.</p>
  <p> Also because people live according to patterns or rhythms during a normal work week, language usually follows this rhythmic pace.</p>
  <p> Consequently, high-pressured people speak quicker, because their language rhythm is an expression of their life's rhythm.</p>
  <p> The ability to talk fast varies with each person, but it is directly related to your ability to think fast.</p>
  <p> Your normal speaking rate also coincides with your normal reading rate aloud.</p>
  <p> The record for fast reading aloud was set in 1988 by Ms.</p>
  <p> Fran Capo with 682 wpm.</p>
  <p> That's faster than most people read silently!</p>
  <p> Now read the paragraph below as fast as you can aloud; then record the time it takes you.</p>
  <p> Move your manual to the left, and read the paragraph in your left field of vision.</p>
  <p> Again, record your time.</p>
  <p> Now move it into your right field of vision, and read it as fast as you can again.</p>
  <p> Notice any difference in your flow and speed in the 3 positions?</p>
  <p> Now move it wherever you like, and do it 3 more times to keep improving your time.</p>
  <p> Biodynamic farming involves working with the energies which create and maintain life.</p>
  <p> Instead of indiscriminate distribution of vast quantities of compost and organic materials over the soil, the correct disposition of specific quantities of specific qualities of organics can better maximize your crop's potential more effectively.</p>
  <p> It is far more complex than just planting crops organically.</p>
  <p> There is an integrated relationship between plant, animal and soil that must be understood.</p>
  <p> Biodynamic farming involves restoring to the soil a balanced living condition.</p>
  <p> Crop rotation, correct composting and proper intercropping can all contribute to a healthier biodynamic yield.</p>
  <p> ____________ 1st time _____________ 4th time ____________ 2nd time _____________ 5th time ____________ 3rd time _____________ 6th time One form of dyslexia is greatly alleviated by simply wearing certain colored eyeglasses or putting colored glassine overlays on top of reading material.</p>
  <p> Can normal readers increase their speed with colored overlays?</p>
  <p> Place a blue, green and red colored overlay separately on top of the paragraph below & time yourself with each reading; then time the reading without an overlay.</p>
  <p> Which way provides you with a better speed and flow?</p>
  <p> Appropriate technology is a broad term that recognizes that different cultural and geographical populations will have different technologies that are appropriate to their circumstances.</p>
  <p> It acknowledges that the only wise technologies are those which seek to accommodate themselves to the biological environment within which they are used.</p>
  <p> It assumes that the purpose of any economically productive activity is to produce what is determined by need, in an enjoyable, creative process, as opposed to what is determined by endless greed.</p>
  <p> If local production suited local needs, less dependency on outside economy would be necessary.</p>
  <p> Blue _______ Green _______ Red _______ None _______ Now read the paragraph of mirror language as fast as you can, with and without the overlays, and note any difference in your time?</p>
  <p> Blue _______ Green _______ Red _______ None _______ Now read the upside down paragraph below as fast as you can, with and without the overlays.</p>
  <p> What was the difference in your time?</p>
  <p> Blue _______ Green _______ Red _______ None _______ When wearing special tinted contact lenses, the tinting is not noticed by the wearer.</p>
  <p> Perhaps the future will discover different colored lenses that will optimize specific brain processing modalities suited to each individual's needs.</p>
