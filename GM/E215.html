  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 215 </p><h1>Sending Bulk Information Telepathically</h1>
  <p> In "<a href="GM/E179.html">Exercise 179 - Learn Through Time Distortion</a>," you learned that vast quantities of material could be mentally reviewed in mere seconds by your mind.</p>
  <p> By using the time distortion technique, telepathic transmission between two minds in 'synch' can convey great quantities of information in mere seconds.</p>
  <p> This is NOT a technique to rob another mind of information, but only one to transmit and receive bulk material in a volitional fashion.</p>
  <p> After mastering "<a href="GM/E189.html">Exercise 189 - Audio Telepathy</a>" and "<a href="GM/E188.html">Exercise 188 - Visual Telepathy</a>," you are ready to combine those techniques with those learned in "<a href="GM/E179.html">Exercise 179 - Learn Through Time Distortion</a>.</p>
  <p> Assume a comfortable position and face your partner (who has also mastered the aforementioned exercises).</p>
  <p> Both of you should now get into a self-hypnotic state (review "<a href="GM/E176.html">Exercise 176 - Learning Self-Hypnosis</a>") and clear your minds.</p>
  <p> Have someone start a metronome at 60 beats per minute.</p>
  <p> The sender now uses the time distortion technique, and experiences each beat interval as 4 minutes apart.</p>
  <p> The sender acknowledges that this is so by saying, "I'm ready.</p>
  <p> The sender reviews the material mentally in a time distorted fashion as he reaches out with his mind and transmits it to the receiver.</p>
  <p> The receiver now mentally pulses his body towards the sender as in "<a href="GM/E189.html">Exercise 189 - Audio Telepathy</a>.</p>
  <p> Even though the receiver's mind is not in a time distorted mode, the transmission is readily acknowledged and received almost in a subliminal fashion.</p>
  <p> Depending upon many associative factors in the receiver's brain, the material will be retained for varying lengths of time.</p>
  <p> To amplify transmission, review "<a href="GM/E151.html">Exercise 151 - Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health</a>.</p>
