  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 165 </p><h1>Inner Counselors For Solving Problems</h1>
  <p> Few people become eminent men and women, but most people find themselves admiring other people of the past or present for the qualities they represent.</p>
  <p> To utilize the vast storehouse of moral opinion and knowledge in your subconscious, the invisible counselor visualization is a powerful one.</p>
  <p> Think of 2 or more people that you admire or respect because of certain attributes they possess and write their names down.</p>
  <p> Now just before going to sleep at night, imagine these people sitting at a council table with you for the purpose of solving your problems for you.</p>
  <p> Visualize an appropriate personality for each one and direct your problem to the council table for suggestions and a possible solution.</p>
  <p> Do this nightly and you'll be astounded at the individual mannerisms and characteristics each imaginary person will adopt in relating to you.</p>
  <p> This is just another method of drawing on your own inner reserve for assistance in problematic situations.</p>
  <p> Dale Carnegie credited many of his successful decisions to a similar technique where he imagined certain of the world's greatest minds sitting at a meeting of his own personal board of directors.</p>
  <p> Every time he had a problem, he would imagine going to his board of directors to seek the advice of those great minds.</p>
  <p> The answers he got from them proved quite valuable to him.</p>
  <p> A good variation of this technique is to visualize a constant companion or guide that is always with you throughout the day -- sitting alongside you in the car, chatting with you at the dinner table, walking with you on the beach, giving you love and positive encouragement, etc.</p>
  <p> For Christians, Jesus Christ is an excellent companion for a troubled person.</p>
  <p> With others, a different personage can be visualized.</p>
  <p> Carl Jung had an imaginary old sage named Philemon who often gave him strong insight into the problem areas of his life.</p>
  <p> In fact, much of the "channeling" of today is simply the creation of internal personality assists to guide people along.</p>
  <p> Whether you read the Bible or ancient philosophical treatises, they all steer you toward the axiom: "The answers lie within you."</p>
  <p> Another variation is to fantasize new or problematic situations being properly handled by a visualized character model.</p>
  <p> By picturing somebody you respect dealing with your problems or situational circumstances ahead of time, you can more effectively see how to put yourself in such situations.</p>
  <p> In this way, you can get around any self-imposed limitations that are blocking your progress.</p>
