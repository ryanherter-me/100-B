  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 164 </p><h1>Asking For Inner Guidance</h1>
  <p> In times past, people were often thought to be crazy if they heard "voices" in their head.</p>
  <p> Nevertheless everyone has experienced that little voice call your "conscience" in the back of your head telling you right from wrong in times of dilemma.</p>
  <p> As a prelude to the following exercise, do "<a href="EM/E025.html">Exercise 25 - Better Breathing, Better Emotions</a>" first.</p>
  <p> Now in a relaxed state, say to yourself 3 times, "My inner eye and inner ear are now opening to receive the intuitive expression of inner guidance that I seek."</p>
  <p> Afterwards, sit in silence and await the answer to which you are seeking.</p>
  <p> It'll come and you'll be surprised at first.</p>
  <p> Then you'll wonder if it is an outside entity speaking to you or just your own "conscience."</p>
  <p> What does it matter -- as long as the answer is true enough and you can relate to it?</p>
  <p> You might even prime the process by getting into the habit of a little self-talk each day.</p>
  <p> Then openly listen for the answers that come and start a dialogue back and forth.</p>
  <p> Visual minded people can sometimes access the same guidance through letting the non-dominant hand write the answers.</p>
