  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 159 </p><h1>Do You Have Any Idea?</h1>
  <p> Have you ever said "I have no idea" to a question put to you, when you really didn't stop to think about it at all?</p>
  <p> With just a little application of logical thought, you will find that you can easily have an idea on matters that you previously thought you had no idea about.</p>
  <p> If you take the trouble to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, many ideas will come to you.</p>
  <p> For instance, do you have any idea of what the circumference of the earth is?</p>
  <p> No, Huh?</p>
  <p> OK, let's break it down.</p>
  <p> There's a 3-hour time zone difference between the East coast and the West coast of the U.S., right?</p>
  <p> They are also about 3,000 miles apart, right?</p>
  <p> If it takes 24 hours in a day for the earth to complete one rotation on its axis, and 1 hour is equivalent to about 1,000 miles, then the earth must be about 24,000 miles in circumference, right? (It is actually 24,902.45 miles.)</p>
  <p> Are you fed up with pollution of the air, water, food and soil?</p>
  <p> Do you feel helpless about it?</p>
  <p> Do you have any idea how to stop it?</p>
  <p> Of course, you're not the president of the United States, but you ARE an exceptional thinking citizen of the U.S.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, close your eyes for a moment, and step into the feeling of being such a special individual.</p>
  <p> Trigger your anchor for self-confidence (review "<a href="EM/E002.html">Exercise 2 - Anchoring Positive States of Mind</a>").</p>
  <p> Feel the power at your command as your mind fills and surges with ideas.</p>
  <p> Now open your eyes, and as this citizen of the U.S., break down the problem of air pollution into smaller subproblems, and write down in a notebook a creative way to solve the problem of air pollution from your citizen level.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, proceed with water, soil and food pollution in a similar fashion.</p>
  <p> Most people don't think about large problems for too long because they feel that it's just too sizable for them to do anything about.</p>
  <p> When you seriously do think about such problems, you quickly find that there is something you CAN do about them after all.</p>
