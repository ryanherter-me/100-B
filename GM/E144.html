  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 144 </p><h1>Imaging To Bring Luck & Happiness</h1>
  <p> "Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans; that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too.</p>
  <p> All sorts of things occur to help one that would otherwise not have occurred.</p>
  <p> A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way.</p>
  <p> Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, do it.</p>
  <p> Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.</p>
  <p> Begin it now."</p>
  <p> Goethe Our outer world of circumstances shapes itself from our inner world of thought.</p>
  <p> YOU hold the key to your own happiness by exercising your power to choose your own thoughts.</p>
  <p> A thought is the crystalline predecessor to action.</p>
  <p> People often change their environment, but are reluctant to change themselves.</p>
  <p> To change your 'luck,' change your attitude.</p>
  <p> Commit yourself to the accomplishment of your dream.</p>
  <p> How can you achieve happiness or peace of mind when your thoughts are contrary to it?</p>
  <p> People preoccupied with fears and worries draw to themselves that which they fear and worry about the most, sometimes called 'bad luck.'</p>
  <p> Inadvertently, they have committed themselves to seeing the world with fear and worry, hence they receive what their minds dwell upon.</p>
  <p> Even random thoughts and those in the back of the mind must be consciously controlled so you can focus on what you truly want out of life.</p>
  <p> There is little mystery here.</p>
  <p> The greater the clarity, energy and focus you project (your committment) onto what you want, the faster and easier it is unveiled for you.</p>
  <p> Resonance is demonstrated when we play the E note on a piano and all the other E strings start to vibrate as well, responding in resonance with the first one played.</p>
  <p> The thought images and emotions you project forth from yourself vibrate as well, and people who are resonating similar thoughts and emotions will be attracted to you and you to them in what often appears to be pure accident.</p>
  <p> Learn to see things the way you want them to be with love, courage, enthusiasm and excitement.</p>
  <p> Learn to treat people the way you would like to be treated, and you not only improve their mental atmosphere, but your own as well!</p>
  <p> As a precursor to this exercise, do "<a href="EM/E017.html">Exercise 17 - Concentration To Relieve Stress</a>" first.</p>
  <p> Now think about what would bring about a happy state in your life and hold that image.</p>
  <p> Place yourself there and experience what it is like.</p>
  <p> For example, a man visualized owning an expensive sports car, but to his surprise, found that it did not feel good to him when he placed himself in the mental scene of possessing it.</p>
  <p> Mental imagery allows you to try on different roles to see how they feel to you.</p>
  <p> After determining what images would bring about happiness in your life, begin to crystallize and replay those images in your daily life.</p>
  <p> Learn that you are in control of your thoughts and use your thought power to change them to happy thoughts.</p>
  <p> Create images involving smell, taste, touch and hearing in your visual scenes for better detail, but keep the visualizations directed toward activation.</p>
  <p> Be the person you imagine yourself can be, and you will no longer have to put yourself down and be the person you don't want to be.</p>
  <p> Do you blame the circumstances around you or other people for the things that happen to you?</p>
  <p> Do you wait for someone or something to come along to change matters in your life?</p>
  <p> Catch yourself from saying, "I never have any luck," or "I KNEW that would happen to me" when something 'bad' happens.</p>
  <p> Begin to realize that you bring about your own luck -- whether it be good or bad -- by the thoughts you hold in your mind.</p>
  <p> By changing your concept of your limitations, you realize that luck is not random, but is manipulated by your own consciousness to produce the so-called coincidences in your everyday life.</p>
  <p> Care in selecting your thought patterns during just one day can make big changes in your life.</p>
  <p> What you radiate in thought is what you attract in reality.</p>
  <p> There are no coincidental meetings with others that take place.</p>
  <p> All relationships in whatever form or manner are purposeful experiences for you and they are called into your personal sphere for specific growthoriented reasons.</p>
  <p> You create your own reality.</p>
  <p> So know that everything is as it needs to be, no matter how it appears at the moment.</p>
  <p> When people achieve that which they have visualized, they often attribute it just to 'luck,' and never see themselves responsible for its creation!</p>
  <p> To prove to yourself that your visualization is working, list at the end of the day any 'chance' events or happenings that 'luckily' went your way or led in the direction of what you visualized.</p>
  <p> These are indications that you are activating the right mental processes.</p>
  <p> Keep a record of your results and your progress each day, and reread to yourself periodically how things are working out for you.</p>
  <p> This listing process also has a tendency to reinforce your faith in yourself and keeps you focused.</p>
