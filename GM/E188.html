  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 188 </p><h1>Visual Telepathy</h1>
  <p> Since Peter Hurkos and other telepaths have exhibited their telepathic abilities inside a Faraday cage, (a copper-walled enclosure with 25,000 volts of electricity shielding out even radio waves), thought energy does not solely function along electromagnetic theorems.</p>
  <p> If fact, ESP experiments were performed at a phenomenally higher success rate with this screening out of interfering, electromagnetic carrier waves of extraneous energies (see "<a href="GM/E214.html">Exercise 214 - Psionic and Psychotronic Generators</a>").</p>
  <p> Telepathy often seems augmented or combined with other energies like radiomicrowaves, but at other times it acts totally independent of electromagnetic influence.</p>
  <p> It appears that belief and faith are the thought processes that mostly affect the energy, combined with honesty and the positive higher emotions of love, compassion and happiness.</p>
  <p> Practice trusting and loving yourself; and be truthful with yourself to allow your telepathic ability to improve.</p>
  <p> Honesty gives you clarity by clearing away the blockages of muddled and secretive thinking (review “<a href="EM/E008.html">Exercise 8 - Honesty For Better Clarity</a>”).</p>
  <p> Then focus to differentiate your own thoughts from those of others.</p>
  <p> At the very least, leave the possibility open in your mind that you can telepathically communicate.</p>
  <p> Now take a partner of the opposite sex and sit in a relaxed position facing each other.</p>
  <p> Silently look into each other's eyes.</p>
  <p> Many feelings can be discerned by this form of eye contact.</p>
  <p> As the sender, focus on one of these feelings to the exclusion of all others and emanate this to your partner.</p>
  <p> Eliminate any negative feelings and concentrate on positive ones -- love, compassion, joy, humbleness, tolerance, forgiveness, charity, friendliness, self-sacrifice or even curiosity or determination.</p>
  <p> Positive feelings always have a smoother frequency for transmitting purposes.</p>
  <p> With practice, such feelings can be transmitted quite easily.</p>
  <p> Now for this exercise, you need to clip various pictures from magazines displaying emotion-arousing scenes, like a kissing couple, a nursing baby, a starving Ethiopian child, a dying animal from an oil slick, a child playing, a leper, a praying nun, etc.</p>
  <p> Whatever emotion each picture generates in you, hold onto that feeling as a carrier wave to transmit each picture to a partner acting as the telepathic receiver.</p>
  <p> Keep your transmission as clear as possible during this process to allow the purity of the experience to unfold.</p>
  <p> If necessary, visualize yourself with a gag in your mouth to quiet any internal verbalization.</p>
  <p> How clearly a thought is transmitted depends on your ability to concentrate.</p>
  <p> If conflicting thoughts intervene, the recipient will receive a blur.</p>
  <p> It is interesting to note that since deaf and dumb people think more visually, they are often clearer telepathic senders of pictures.</p>
  <p> Visualizing what you want to send while in the alpha/theta brain wave frequency (4 - 14 cycles per second) produces the clarity necessary for effective transmission of thought forms.</p>
  <p> The earth resonates at 7.5 - 7.83 cycles per second, and synchronizing your brain wave output to this exact frequency produces natural amplitude to your telepathic energy.</p>
  <p> Thought projections are associated with ELF (extremely low frequency) energy on the low end of the electromagnetic spectrum with very long wavelengths.</p>
  <p> With sufficient amplitude, you can telepathically transmit ELF waves of illusion to onlookers and phase lock their minds into seeing something that's not really there.</p>
  <p> The Indian fakir's rope trick is just one such illusion.</p>
  <p> The Indian rope trick involves an illusion telepathically sent by the fakir into the minds of all the subconsciously susceptible onlookers.</p>
  <p> Everyone except the occasional consciously aware person will be duped into seeing a scene that does not exist.</p>
  <p> Wolf Messing was a reputed telepath that could send a visual illusion with such clarity that he once got past Stalin's bodyguards by implanting the thought in their minds that he looked like the head of the Soviet secret police.</p>
  <p> For further proof of his power, he staged a fake robbery of a Soviet bank by pushing a blank piece of paper to the teller and implanting the visual illusion that it was a negotiable check for 100,000 rubles.</p>
  <p> Since most people's minds are running on unconscious levels throughout the day, consciously synchronizing your thought vibrations can create resonant wave-locks with their minds.</p>
  <p> When you transmit a clear and focused message to a unconsciously functioning person, the illusion is established.</p>
  <p> By choosing the right moment, a telepathic visualization coupled with the proper verbal suggestion can work wonders.</p>
  <p> For instance, the aforementioned bank teller and bodyguards were expecting what they saw.</p>
  <p> Choosing the right moment is waiting until the person asks you into his 'sphere' by accosting or questioning you.</p>
  <p> You can even create the illusion of invisibility through this technique of entrainment.</p>
  <p> By entraining someone's mind into a resonant frequency with your own mind (like a strobe light brings about epileptic seizures in some people), you can implant the visualization of invisibility.</p>
  <p> Remember, a person sees or perceives you with his brain, not his eyes.</p>
  <p> A highly skilled person can simply reflect back your eye beam energy with an illusion of his own, rather than with what is really perceivable.</p>
  <p> Sometimes the illusion of invisibility can be achieved by visualizing a person's sight buttons being shut-off, or that the light is not reflecting your image back toward the person's eyes.</p>
