  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 208 </p><h1>Scanning A Person</h1>
  <p> Depending upon your abilities, you already scan people to one degree or another upon first meeting them.</p>
  <p> This is part of the process of good judgment in evaluating people by first impressions.</p>
  <p> Unfortunately, the intuitive part of your judgment is often colored by bias and accepted norms that are inculcated into standardized ideologies.</p>
  <p> To truly scan a person's vibrational energies, you must get past the initial superficial remarks, the clothes and any other 'trappings' that are visibly apparent.</p>
  <p> You have to probe and read beyond the fa√ßade that is shown to you on the surface.</p>
  <p> Of course, most of what you will pick up from a person is what you yourself are dealing with in your own life!</p>
  <p> How can recognize in others what you yourself are not experiencing?</p>
  <p> This exercise should only be done with honest, well-balanced individuals.</p>
  <p> Sit facing a partner and get into a relaxed frame of mind.</p>
  <p> You act as the scanner, and the other person acts as the subject.</p>
  <p> Look into each other's eyes for a few moments.</p>
  <p> Now tell the other person all you can about what you are picking up from him.</p>
  <p> Imagine and relate a story about what you think his life was like in the past.</p>
  <p> This is meant as a helpful exercise, so please concentrate on the positive points and feelings that you receive.</p>
  <p> Many times telepathic pictures and impressions will pop forth.</p>
  <p> At other times, there appears to be an intuitive knowing that takes place -- perhaps like subliminally reading the subject's aura or body language.</p>
  <p> As a variation to this exercise, blindfold yourself and hold the subject's hands (with jewelry removed) while scanning him.</p>
  <p> CAUTION: If either person has any reservations about revealing themselves to the other person, please don't participate in this exercise.</p>
  <p> This is not meant as an invasion of privacy, but simply as a mutual volitional exchange.</p>
  <p> You can practice using your scanning skill by looking at a stranger at a party and imagining what this person's life is like, where they've been and how knowledgeable they are.</p>
  <p> Create a story about all their imagined experiences, and then start a conversation with them to confirm how accurate you were.</p>
  <p> Another variation of this exercise can be done after you write down a question or a problem with which you need some help or want some information on.</p>
  <p> Without showing your partner what you have written, you begin to concentrate on it.</p>
  <p> Your partner closes his eyes and opens up his mind to your problem or question as you concentrate on it.</p>
  <p> He then begins to describe to you whatever symbols, words or images that come to him, and you write down whatever he says to you.</p>
  <p> Occasionally you might ask him a question about what he is picking up for clarification.</p>
  <p> After- wards, you can compare what you wrote with what you posed as your problem to determine any connections.</p>
  <p> Next, you reverse the roles and do the same thing for your partner.</p>
