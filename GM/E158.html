  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 158 </p><h1>Creative Alternatives</h1>
  <p> Are you looking for a trouble free life?</p>
  <p> Don't you think that every time you take the trouble to figure out solutions to your problems, you grow?</p>
  <p> Those that insulate themselves from troubles often become greatly troubled inside for a lack of something they can't quite define.</p>
  <p> There's a sense of adventure and accomplishment that goes hand in hand with figuring out solutions to your so-called problems in life.</p>
  <p> Without these challenges, you wither away and vegetate.</p>
  <p> Did you ever wonder why the magnitude of world problems are measured in dollar signs?</p>
  <p> If money solved all problems and brought happiness, then all rich people and all rich countries would be happy and free of any major problems, right?</p>
  <p> Have you ever felt helpless about all the problems in the world?</p>
  <p> As an exercise, make a list of all the times in your life when your actions caused a chain of events to take place that affected major changes in another person's life.</p>
  <p> After looking over your list, you can readily see how you as one person can do a great deal in your lifetime to affect important changes in the world.</p>
  <p> Now list in a notebook all the creative alternatives that you as a world citizen with your present abilities can do to help correct the problems of pollution (air, food, water & soil), crime, drug addiction, the homeless and poor education without spending hardly any money.</p>
  <p> Next list in your notebook all the important things that happened to you last week that involved an outlay of money?</p>
  <p> Next, list in a notebook all the important things that happened to you last week that didn't involve any money at all?</p>
