  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 220 </p><h1>Making The Time</h1>
  <p> Have you ever heard someone complain about something over and over, yet when helpful solutions are offered, no action is taken?</p>
  <p> It's as if they wanted to stay stuck in their situation?!</p>
  <p> Avoidance of responsibility and fear of making a mistake keeps many people confused.</p>
  <p> It was once said, "Life is easy, it's the decisions in life that are tough.</p>
  <p> How many times have you thought or said you would do one thing, but wound up doing something totally different or nothing at all?</p>
  <p> Do you put off or take the time to do little 3 minute tasks around the house?</p>
  <p> So much time is wasted everyday by most people in unproductive pursuits and activities.</p>
  <p> Have you ever said to someone, "I don't have time to do (such and such)?</p>
  <p> Some of the busiest people in the world find time in their lives to do the things they want to do.</p>
  <p> How?</p>
  <p> They make the time by proper scheduling!</p>
  <p> To them, there is no such thing as not having the time to do something.</p>
  <p> They create it by first NOT programming their minds that they don't have the time to spare.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in utilizing all time morsels of the day to your advantage, carry a little jingle bell in your pocket as a periodic reminder.</p>
  <p> Every time you hear the little bell tinkle, practice one of the manual exercises.</p>
  <p> Stop exaggerating in conversations (review "<a href="/EM/E008.html">Exercise 8 - Honesty For Better Clarity</a>").</p>
  <p> Issue positive statements to yourself and those around you (review "<a href="/EM/E006.html">Exercise 6 - Positive Affirming, Positive Living</a>").</p>
  <p> Drink in and absorb the simultaneity of your surroundings (review "<a href="/MT/E123.html">Exercise 123 - A Multiple Hearing Acuity</a>").</p>
  <p> See and don't just look at the diversity of your environment, and consciously remember more (review "<a href="/SM/E084.html">Exercise 84 - Observational Recall</a>").</p>
  <p> Eliminate tension and stress in your life (review "<a href="/EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>").</p>
  <p> Do mental calculations (review "<a href="/GM/E173.html">Exercise 173 - Mental Multiplication</a>").</p>
  <p> Observe and study people (review "<a href="/GM/E209.html">Exercise 209 - Discerning Body Language</a>").</p>
  <p> Make use of the moments just before falling to sleep.</p>
  <p> Implant a suggestion into the subconscious that can be acted upon during the night.</p>
  <p> Heal and repair all your bodily cells.</p>
  <p> Visualize yourself healthy, free of negativity or achieving some goal in life.</p>
  <p> Make those time fragments, while driving to work or waiting for an appointment pay off for you through constant mental development.</p>
  <p> Researchers say that over 100,000 of your brain cells deteriorate every day of your life!</p>
  <p> Perhaps if you started utilizing more of them, you could curtail this deterioration process.</p>
