  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 172 </p><h1>Lightning Calendar Calculating</h1>
  <p> One of the commonest feats of lightning calculators down through the ages is to give the day of the week for any date asked for.</p>
  <p> Even idiot savants have displayed this ability.</p>
  <p> For instance, the twin idiot savants George and Charles, could figure out, virtually instantly, on what day of a week a date fell 2,000 years ago or will fall 2,000 years in the future.</p>
  <p> One researcher, memorizing a complex one-page table, tried unsuccessfully to match the speed of the twins for quite a long time.</p>
  <p> Then suddenly, one day he discovered he could match their speed!</p>
  <p> Quite to his surprise, his brain had somehow automated the complex calculations.</p>
  <p> It had absorbed the calendar table so efficiently that the calculating process was second nature to him, and he no longer had to consciously go through the various operations.</p>
  <p> Perhaps the site of processing migrated from his left brain hemisphere (specializing in logical, sequential, step-by-step calculating) to his right brain hemisphere (grasping patterns of information in a more holistic and simultaneous fashion).</p>
  <p> Autopsies of certain idiot savants that were exceptional in calendar calculating and instant mathematical skills have revealed distinctive neuronal loss in the left hemisphere.</p>
  <p> For 19th, 20th and 21st century calendar calculating, memorize the following 2 tables: FOR CALENDAR CALCULATING Table 1 For any date in the 20th century*- say December Month Add 7, 1941 - start with the last two digits of the year (41).</p>
  <p> Divide this number by 4 (10 and a remainJanuary (leap year 0) || 1 der of 1, disregard the remainder, and add the reFebruary (leap year 3) || 4 sult to the original number (41 plus 10 equals 51).</p>
  <p> March || 4 To this sum, add the number corresponding to the April || 0 month given in Table 1 (51 plus 6 equals 57).</p>
  <p> Add May || 2 the day of the month (57 plus 7 equals 64).</p>
  <p> FinalJune || 5 ly, divide that total by 7 (9 and a remainder of July || 0 1), but this time pay attention only to the remainAugust || 3 der (1).</p>
  <p> In Table 2, pick the day corresponding to September ||6 that number.</p>
  <p> The answer is Sunday.</p>
  <p> October || 1 November || 4 *For the 19th century, add 2 to the final total; for December || 6 the 21st century, subtract 1.</p>
  <p> Tabel 2 Remainder Day 0 || Saturday 1 || Sunday 2 || Monday 3 || Tuesday 4 || Wednesday 5 || Thursday 6 || Friday</p>
