  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 169 </p><h1>Solving Problems With Intuition</h1>
  <p> Intuition has been defined as a knowledge gained without rational thought, and it often includes subconsciously perceived information.</p>
  <p> It's like knowing something without knowing how you know it.</p>
  <p> Intuitive people tend to be independent and self-confident.</p>
  <p> These qualities are needed requisites to be open to this unpredictable, surprising and often unconventional source of knowledge that comes from within yourself.</p>
  <p> Nevertheless, this is a brain skill that can be learned.</p>
  <p> Now get into a comfortable, relaxed position and do some deep, abdominal breathing (review "<a href="/EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>").</p>
  <p> Quiet your mind.</p>
  <p> Concentrate and review your problem thoroughly from all angles with as much information as possible.</p>
  <p> Suspend your judgment; then simply 'let go' and don't think about the problem anymore.</p>
  <p> Allow yourself a sense of alert awareness.</p>
  <p> Tune in and be aware of yourself physically, mentally and emotionally.</p>
  <p> Visualize yourself on a relaxing train journey crossing the country.</p>
  <p> Feel calm and relaxed as town after town, home after home pass on by.</p>
  <p> With no thoughts of any cares or worries, you're simply observing the world go by.</p>
  <p> By letting the logical mind rest, the intuitive mind often comes up with the answers after your conscious focus has been switched away from it.</p>
  <p> Do this "stating of the problem and letting go procedure" just before you meditate or go to sleep and the solution will frequently pop up later.</p>
  <p> Where do these answers come from?</p>
  <p> First, they come from your own accumulated source of knowledge and experience; second, from the minds of others picked up telepathically; and third, from the universal consciousness of Infinite knowledge.</p>
  <p> Sometimes the answers come in the form of symbolic visions or dreams.</p>
  <p> So be alert to them.</p>
