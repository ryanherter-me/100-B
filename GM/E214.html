  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 214 </p><h1>Psionic and Psychotronic Generators</h1>
  <p> Psionic generators are devices that are activated by the energy streaming from your eyes.</p>
  <p> Psychotronic generators are devices that amplify your thought energy.</p>
  <p> After suffering under years of criticism, a lot of serious research has been done to validate such devices.</p>
  <p> Years ago the CIA reportedly learned that the Soviets were using powerful psychotronic generators to amplify and beam harmful ELF (extremely low frequency) thought transmissions to major U.S. cities (in some case using radio-microwaves as carrier waves).</p>
  <p> U.S. researchers undertook their own research to counteract the Soviet threat.</p>
  <p> Some researchers have found that producing and synchronizing man-made magnetic waves to the alpha brain wave frequency of 10 cycles per second in a subject could induce suppressed emotional images of fear.</p>
  <p> If amplified and generated directly at a segment of the population, these ELF waves could potentially manipulate people into producing bizarre behavioral patterns.</p>
  <p> Most people are already beset with various forms of ELF thought energy from other people around them all day long.</p>
  <p> This "mental noise" comes to you in the form of visualizations or voices and might constitute 50 - 75% of your idle thought patterns that often guide many of your impulse reactions.</p>
  <p> This subliminal entrainment of your mind is augmented constantly with what you see in newspapers and on the TV, and how you interact with other people.</p>
  <p> When high sun spot activity affects radio waves, people are affected too.</p>
  <p> Can your ELF thought transmissions be amplified by the constant presence of radio waves around you acting as carrier frequencies?</p>
  <p> The microwaves that the Soviets were using in a directional way might be already happening in a non-directional, worldwide way with radio waves (microwaves are radio wave frequencies).</p>
  <p> As the souls of the world pick up tempo in a spiral downhill toward decadence, other souls elsewhere in the world (radio waves are everywhere) could be entrained in similar behavior because of the amplified ELF thought transmissions carried by radio waves.</p>
  <p> How can you become a skilled individual to protect or shield yourself from unwanted ELF influences generated by millions of negatively oriented souls?</p>
  <p> Think a minute.</p>
  <p> First be aware that something must be happening like this already in the world today.</p>
  <p> If someone yelled fire in a theater, would you be easily swept up and phase-locked into a panicky condition?</p>
  <p> Do you react to unfamiliar situations in an individualistic thinking manner or in an emotional, group-oriented, non-thinking capacity?</p>
  <p> To counteract the subliminal entrainment of your mind, question yourself periodically about your actions.</p>
  <p> Next, consciously clear your mind of all negative thought patterns.</p>
  <p> Well you say, "That's what it's all about, isn't it?</p>
  <p> There's a difference though.</p>
  <p> If you knew someone was pointing a mind control gun at you to implant a subliminal, negative condition in you, wouldn't you CONSCIOUSLY want to counteract it and rebuff its influence?</p>
  <p> Of course you would.</p>
  <p> Then take conscious control over a positive life style for yourself, because negative influences ARE 'pointed' at you!</p>
  <p> Clear your mind of all the subliminal stuff that is subconsciously directing you into acting like a robot, and get down to living in a productive way.</p>
  <p> Improve yourself and develop your mental skills, instead of carrying around a deteriorating lump of gray matter with you all day that's too tired to think or even get conscious in the morning.</p>
  <p> Don't go for the pills or the booze or something to heighten or deaden the senses.</p>
  <p> The next time a negative surge is upon you, assume it is directed at you for a purpose, and refuse to countenance it.</p>
  <p> Use your conscious will power to reject the impression.</p>
  <p> Just as sound can cancel out sound, your natural electromagnetic energy field can do the same as long as you consciously direct it to do so.</p>
  <p> The more you personally increase your energy amplitude, the easier it will be to turn away an external focus of negativity (review "<a href="/GM/E151.html">Exercise 151 - Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health</a>").</p>
  <p> As an exercise in projecting energy through your eyes, build the following psionic generator.</p>
  <p> First draw 2 perfect circles 7 1/2 inches in diameter with a protractor.</p>
  <p> Cut them out carefully with your scissors and cut an additional quarter piece out of each one leaving a flap.</p>
  <p> Now assemble the cones using a tiny center point indicated in diagram A and tie appropriate knots in your thread to position each one like in diagram B.</p>
  <p> The cone shape is chosen because it is similar to the pyramid shape in accumulating energy.</p>
  <p> Suspend the cones at slightly higher than eye level and away from drafts.</p>
  <p> Look away from them until they become still.</p>
  <p> Since the thread holes are off center, a slight angle is created.</p>
  <p> This angle affords greater sensitivity to your eye beam energy.</p>
  <p> Now look at the cones and observe the reaction.</p>
  <p> Slowly approach the bottom cone from below with the palm of your hand and notice the vibrating effect on both cones.</p>
  <p> Can a mirror reflect your eye beam energy to make the cones move?</p>
  <p> From what distance can you affect the cones?</p>
  <p> Does holding a quartz crystal increase the effect?</p>
  <p> Can you activate the device by simply visualizing that you're looking at it with your eyes closed?</p>
  <p> Can you affect it by look- ing at it with your peripheral vision?</p>
  <p> If the cones were gradually increased in weight and size, could the amplitude of your eye beam energy be determined by the point you no longer could move the cones by looking at them?!</p>
  <p> As an exercise in amplifying your thought waves using a simple psychotronic device, refer to the concentric squares made as a chart in "<a href="/HS/E116.html">Exercise 116 - Aura Seeing</a>.</p>
  <p> Look at a picture of a friend to refresh your memory of her appearance.</p>
  <p> Then visualize the image of your friend in the center of the chart as you communicate a message to her.</p>
  <p> Use the tips in "<a href="/GM/E189.html">Exercise 189 - Audio Telepathy</a>" and "<a href="/GM/E188.html">Exercise 188 - Visual Telepathy</a>" as guides in this exercise.</p>
  <p> If you place a snip of hair of your friend (which carries her energy vibration) in the center of the chart in front of you flat on the table (don't place tape or any other material vibrations with it), the telepathic effect will be enhanced as you gaze into the center and send your message.</p>
  <p> The concentric squares represent the same effect as stacking pyramids to intensify energy output.</p>
  <p> Aligning one side to north and putting a small magnet under it with the N pole aimed to north also enhances the effect.</p>
  <p> Various psychotronic devices are sold under various names, but they're all simply tuning instruments that act as waveguides for your thought transmissions.</p>
  <p> They vary in their effectiveness according to your belief structure (review "<a href="/IT/E052.html">Exercise 52 - Improving Your Visualization Skills</a>").</p>
  <p> Since a scoffer's thought vibrations are different than a believer's, the devices work differently with different people.</p>
