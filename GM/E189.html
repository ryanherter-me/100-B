  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 189 </p><h1>Audio Telepathy</h1>
  <p> Research has revealed that telepathic information is carried by extremely low frequency (ELF) waves.</p>
  <p> Just as sea salt is used to 'clear' crystals of accumulated vibrations (see "<a href="/GM/E203.html">Exercise 203 - Using Quartz Crystals</a>"), telepathic subjects in submarines often get muddled impressions in very deep seawater when trying to pick up target subjects miles away on dry land.</p>
  <p> Telepathic ELF waves have very long wave lengths and can pass through almost anything except very deep seawater.</p>
  <p> Of course, the Navy has succeeded in projecting electronic ELF waves through sea water with amplified generators, so it all depends on amplitude.</p>
  <p> At least 50 - 75% of the idle thoughts coming into your mind are simply being picked up from other minds around you.</p>
  <p> We are always sending and receiving impressions from other minds on a subtle level that coalesce and form many of our ideas and thought processes.</p>
  <p> We just donâ€™t know the source or even that it is happening.</p>
  <p> We think we are the originators of all our ideas.</p>
  <p> The trick is to tune that delicate thought receiver in your head and pick out the thoughts you want to receive.</p>
  <p> That's a telepath.</p>
  <p> Identical twins often find it easy to do this with each other because of their similar vibrational patterns, but how can you do it?</p>
  <p> As an exercise, practice with a partner (preferably someone you know well) in a separate room.</p>
  <p> Assume a comfortable, relaxed position and take a few deep breaths.</p>
  <p> Affirm to yourself that you believe you are telepathically receptive.</p>
  <p> Still your mind by visualizing a large blackboard or a giant snowbank.</p>
  <p> Now look at a photograph of the person in the other room and visualize that person in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Establishing this conscious awareness of the sender helps you to produce a resonant frequency and enhances telepathic reception.</p>
  <p> Ask yourself, "What is this person saying to me?"</p>
  <p> Frame your thoughts, and say to the photograph mentally, "Talk to me, talk to me."</p>
  <p> Then await a reply.</p>
  <p> After a while, you'll get a stirring inside your brain.</p>
  <p> At first you might say it's just imagination, but don't.</p>
  <p> If you dismiss your receptivity to idle imagination, you'll dismiss telepathy.</p>
  <p> Let the sender transmit a verbal message that contains emotionally provocative words for better reception.</p>
  <p> Also, let the sender experiment with sending emotional words in a foreign language (unknown to you) and see what happens.</p>
  <p> Have the sender pulse out his message to you through rhythmic breathing (see "<a href="/EM/E026.html">Exercise 26 - Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes</a>") as he visualizes your face in his mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Rhythm has been shown to greatly assist telepathic abilities.</p>
  <p> Pulsing the message in a steady beat facilitates the transmission process.</p>
  <p> Slow pulsing strobes on closed eyes have proven helpful, but synchronizing your breathing with the beat of your heart is more natural.</p>
  <p> If you use a metronome at 60 beats per minute, your heart will soon simulate that same relaxed rhythm and your brain wave cycle will slow to alpha in response.</p>
  <p> Some people improve their reception by visualizing a mental body movement in seeking the target answer.</p>
  <p> The receiver imagines he is skating in a slow, pulsing rhythm toward and around the sender.</p>
  <p> If the sender is in the same room, a metronome beating at 60 strokes per minute can be heard by both sender and receiver.</p>
  <p> The sender can then easily synchronize his rhythm as well.</p>
  <p> He visualizes his mental body moving toward and around the receiver in exactly the same rhythm.</p>
  <p> This rhythmic rapport greatly facilitates transmission and reception.</p>
  <p> You might also visualize holding onto a giant, grandfather clock pendulum that is swaying back and forth to the beat of the metronome.</p>
  <p> Hanging suspended in midair, you mentally approach your telepathic partner in a side to side rhythm.</p>
  <p> In either case, feel the kinesthetic inner movement for maximum effect.</p>
  <p> Next, both you and your partner listen to 5 distinctly different musical pieces.</p>
  <p> Mentally without telling your partner, choose one of them for yourself.</p>
  <p> Now sit facing each other and begin emanating a positive feeling to your partner to the exclusion of all other thoughts.</p>
  <p> Now begin playing in your mind the musical piece you chose out of the 5 while maintaining your positive emotional transmission.</p>
  <p> Did your partner succeed in picking up the musical sounds?</p>
  <p> A side benefit to this exercise is that every time the transmitter hears that same musical piece in the future, the same generated emotion may be aroused!</p>
  <p> The next time you're talking to a friend, prearrange ahead of time that it is okay to interrupt each other by announcing telepathic impressions that the other feels he is receiving.</p>
  <p> Be honest with each other and experiment with different methods.</p>
  <p> One final note: Use telepathy to help people, and with practice in telepathic listening, you'll even discern messages in unknown languages as well (see "<a href="/GM/E198.html">Exercise 198 - Understanding Any Spoken Language</a>").</p>
