  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 193 </p><h1>Vibrational Effect On Plants</h1>
  <p> Years ago when researchers hooked up philodendrons with instrumentation to record any perceptible vascular changes in their leaves and stems, the results were surprising.</p>
  <p> After crushing one plant in the presence of other philodendrons, sharp reactions were noted in the "onlooking" plants.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, even mere thoughts of crushing the remaining plants brought about the same recordable responses in the plants.</p>
  <p> After these and similar experiments were made known, a rash of people began talking to their plants in various parts of the world.</p>
  <p> People started to realize that their emotional thoughts could actually affect their plants' growing condition.</p>
  <p> ("And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever. And presently the fig tree withered away. Matt. 21:19)</p>
  <p> As an exercise in affecting plants with your mind, plant an identical number of vegetable seeds in 3 different pots.</p>
  <p> Label one positive, one negative and one neutral.</p>
  <p> For 5 or 10 minutes each day, bestow loving, encouraging thoughts or blessings and prayer over the positive pot.</p>
  <p> Visualize strong and healthy growth in the plants.</p>
  <p> Then communicate emotional thoughts of hate, anger, frustration and discouragement to the negative pot, and ignore the neutral pot entirely.</p>
  <p> After a few weeks, compare the growth in the pots to see if your emotional thoughts have any observable influence.</p>
  <p> As an additional exercise, label 3 large jars of water -- positive, negative and neutral.</p>
  <p> Transmit the same visualizations and subjective thought processes to the water as you previously did to the seeds and growing plants.</p>
  <p> Do this for 5 or 10 minutes each day for 2 weeks.</p>
  <p> Then after labeling 3 more pots of vegetable seeds in the same way as the previous exercise, use only this water to see which one sprouts first and grows more vigorously.</p>
  <p> Now place a moist seed in the palm of your hand and ask it to grow rapidly.</p>
  <p> Fully associate yourself in this process, and emotionally "feel" it filling up with energy in readiness to sprout.</p>
  <p> Do this while issuing a single musical note, whistle or chant (AUM, OOM, YAM, RAM, etc.).</p>
  <p> Plant it and record its sprouting time vs a control planting.</p>
  <p> Research has revealed that single pure tones issued as above seem to contribute to faster seed sprouting.</p>
  <p> Follow the same procedure with your other hand, and compare any differences in your results.</p>
  <p> When you can sprout the seed in your hand before planting it, you're making good progress and are on the road to having the ability of materialization!</p>
