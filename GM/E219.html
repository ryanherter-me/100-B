  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 219 </p><h1>The Effect Of Symbols</h1>
  <p> At the age of 3, a child's brain usually struggles to adequately copy geometric symbols of squares, triangles or star, but at the age of 5, the brain of a normal child is organizing information well enough to do so.</p>
  <p> All environmental perceptions affect you through their form.</p>
  <p> Through visualization, it is possible for a skilled individual to negate the effects of form, but for most people, how you resonate with form and the energies absorbed by it determines how you are affected by it.</p>
  <p> To bring balance and harmony in your life, associate yourself with symbols that will benefit and help you.</p>
  <p> As an exercise to test someone's reaction to symbols kinesiologically (see "<a href="GM/E142.html">Exercise 142 - Improve Your Physical Strength In 7 Days</a>"), have the person stand in front of you with his right arm relaxed at his side and his left arm held straight out parallel to the floor.</p>
  <p> Place your left hand on his right shoulder and your right hand on the person's extended left arm just above the wrist.</p>
  <p> Without smiling or frowning (because this can affect the test), tell the person to resist with all his strength as you try to push his extended arm down.</p>
  <p> Push down on his arm briefly and firmly and test the strength and spring in the arm.</p>
  <p> Now show him different symbols to determine which symbols test weak and which test strong.</p>
  <p> When he tests weak on a symbol and the arm goes down easily, then it is obviously a symbol affecting his energy system in a negative way.</p>
  <p> Experiment with the 5-pointed star vs the 6-pointed star, a clockwise spiral vs a counterclockwise spiral, a hexagon vs a pentagon, the top half of a circle (a frown) vs the bottom half of a circle (a smile), etc.</p>
  <p> a frown a smile In lieu of displaying the symbols physically, have the testee simply visualize them and note the results.</p>
  <p> If no partner is available, use a kinesiometer or dynamometer for your own individual muscle testing.</p>
  <p> Using the Greek cross where the vertical and horizontal arms are of equal length, most people do not test weak.</p>
  <p> Using the Roman cross where the bottom portion of the vertical arm is longer diminishes your strength and you usually test weak.</p>
  <p> The clockwise swastika was an ancient symbol of prosperity and good fortune before it became the emblem for Hitler's Nazi party.</p>
  <p> Even Jewish concentration camp survivors test strong in its presence, displaying a level of symbol response that goes much deeper than individual feelings.</p>
  <p> If you test for the counterclockwise swastika, you might be weak or strong depending on which cerebral hemisphere is dominant.</p>
  <p> If you are cerebrally balanced, neither one will weaken you.</p>
  <p> Also, the more "life energy" you generate (see "<a href="GM/E151.html">Exercise 151 - Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health</a>"), the less affected you will be by symbols or any other environmental factors.</p>
