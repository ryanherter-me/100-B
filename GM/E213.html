  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 213 </p><h1>Manual Dexterity and Coordination</h1>
  <p> Magicians have marvelous finger and hand dexterity.</p>
  <p> Some can cut a deck of cards while holding it in one hand.</p>
  <p> Some can roll a quarter in a flipping fashion on the back of one hand.</p>
  <p> Houdini could pick locks easily with a thin wire in one hand or even with his toes without looking at the lock.</p>
  <p> Manual dexterity and good coordination simply takes practice.</p>
  <p> For instance, practice with one hand buttoning or unbuttoning your shirt, putting on or taking off your clothes, tying your shoelaces, opening screw-cap bottles, etc.</p>
  <p> Many thalidomide babies born without arms lead very full lives.</p>
  <p> Some are musicians and play instruments with their feet.</p>
  <p> Some are artists and paint by gripping the brush with their teeth or feet.</p>
  <p> Everyday chores are undertaken with amazing toe dexterity.</p>
  <p> With your bare feet, practice picking up handkerchiefs, pencils, small balls or other objects.</p>
  <p> Flip a beanbag from one foot to the other, using your toes or your heel, and switching from front shots to hind shots.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in becoming more dexterous with your left hand, strap your right thumb to the inside of your palm with adhesive tape.</p>
  <p> Now proceed through an hour of using your left hand for normal right hand functions.</p>
  <p> Next, have both thumbs strapped to your palms and proceed through the next hour using only your fingers to stir coffee, to turn on lights and to do other activities.</p>
  <p> As an exercise in coordination, hold your hands out in front of you with your palms facing you.</p>
  <p> Now individually bend each finger without bending the others.</p>
  <p> Next, hold your right hand out in front of you and make a V by separating your ring finger and little finger on one side, and your middle finger and index finger on the other.</p>
  <p> Now hold both hands in front of you, but hold your left hand in the V-shape and your right hand with your index finger separated from your middle finger and your little finger separated from your ring finger to make two V's.</p>
  <p> Now simultaneously switch and alternate the single V-hand with the double V-hand back and forth.</p>
  <p> It can often help if you mentally visualize this exercise beforehand.</p>
  <p> All drills of this nature increase neural connections and brain usage in varied ways.</p>
  <p> When these drills can be done successfully and without fatigue, you know you have mastered them.</p>
