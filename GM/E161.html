  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 161 </p><h1>Making Yourself Too Heavy To Be Moved</h1>
  <p> When Marcel Marceau appeared on the "Johnny Carson Show" in 1973, he mentioned that he was studying aikido.</p>
  <p> When asked to demonstrate what he was learning, Marceau sat on the floor and asked Carson to lift him up.</p>
  <p> On the first try, Carson succeeded with little effort in doing so.</p>
  <p> Marceau then began to concentrate, and again sat on the floor and instructed Carson to "lift him" up.</p>
  <p> By Marceau focusing his weight underside, Carson struggled, but could not lift the little man up.</p>
  <p> Aikido is the self-defense art that stresses harmony with all living things.</p>
  <p> It was founded by the late Morihei Uyeshiba who stressed that all things are born of ki, translated to mean "life force."</p>
  <p> The name aikido is derived from ai, meaning to combine, to love; ki, the basic energy of the universe itself; do, the path that all can take.</p>
  <p> In aikido, there are four basic principles:</p>
  <p> 1) Keep centered or balanced.</p>
  <p> One must settle his mind at one point in the lower abdomen, about 2 inches below the navel.</p>
  <p> This point is your center of gravity around which your body weight is evenly distributed.</p>
  <p> 2) Relax completely.</p>
  <p> Relaxation must be both physical and mental.</p>
  <p> The individual must allow his mind to settle down into his center of gravity without his body becoming limp.</p>
  <p> Be aware of your center when you move as well.</p>
  <p> When you walk, sense your movement originating from that point below your navel rather than leading with your head.</p>
  <p> With practice, you will begin to move more smoothly.</p>
  <p> It sometimes helps the centering process on slippery surfaces to push off on each step with the ball of the foot.</p>
  <p> 3) Keep your weight underside.</p>
  <p> Like all physical objects, the weight of every part of the human body should be on its lower region or underside.</p>
  <p> Directing your conscious awareness to your center naturally allows the weight of an individual's body to fall underside.</p>
  <p> 4) Extend you ki.</p>
  <p> All too often, the decision of the mind to move the body is not sufficiently positive and as a consequence, the action of the body is feeble.</p>
  <p> Extending your ki means to direct the body's energies positively with the mind.</p>
  <p> Each one of the four rules is a different expression of the same state of being.</p>
  <p> The first and fourth are rules of the mind.</p>
  <p> The second and third are rules of the body.</p>
  <p> Can the normal gravitational pull be affected by the polarity of your body's energy field?</p>
  <p> Perhaps it's like when you lift a large magnet easily off a non-metallic weight scale, but can't budge it from a metallic scale.</p>
  <p> Doesn't the magnet's weight remain the same (see "<a href="/GM/E196.html">Exercise 196 - Levitation</a>")?</p>
  <p> As an exercise, relax, get centered and take a few deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> Work with a partner and have him lift you up from a sitting or standing position the first time without thinking about anything out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p> On the second time, have him lift you up while you visualize your energy field focused above your head in a giant, diffuse cloud.</p>
  <p> Imagine it flowing upward through your head and 'feel' yourself lighter as if a helium balloon were pulling you up.</p>
  <p> On the third lift, visualize your legs connected to an unbreakable extension through the earth, and imagine your energy field pulling in tightly and flowing downward through your feet.</p>
  <p> Don't tense up your muscles or make any other attempt to help or hinder the lift, but just 'feel' yourself as heavy as lead and immovable.</p>
  <p> Your partner will definitely notice the difference in all three lifts.</p>
  <p> With practice, this visualization technique will enable you to appear too heavy to be moved.</p>
  <p> This process of energy focalization underlies many of the phenomenal skills demonstrated by martial artists.</p>
