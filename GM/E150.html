  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 150 </p><h1>Using Self-Healing Thoughts</h1>
  <p> All doctors acknowledge the power of your mind to heal your body.</p>
  <p> They use terms to explain away such healings like the “placebo effect” or a “state of remission,” but they know it’s your mind that is creating such an effect on your body.</p>
  <p> Your body has a natural ability to protect and heal itself on a day to day basis.</p>
  <p> All so-called “cures” that take place in the world are simply stimulations of your own immune system.</p>
  <p> When your energy is high, so is your health.</p>
  <p> When your energy is low, so is your ability to heal itself, and it’s at this time that you’re most susceptible to ill health.</p>
  <p> Most people have heard of Christian Science practitioners refusing surgical operations on serious ailments -- even cancer -- because of their belief structure of mind over matter.</p>
  <p> How is the process of self-healing done?</p>
  <p> How can you reduce or eliminate your susceptibility to ailments with the power of your mind?</p>
  <p> First of all, you should realize that every particle and atom in the universe is connected in some way to every other particle, and all the particles of your body are closely associated with each other.</p>
  <p> Your body is especially responsive to the programming of the mind.</p>
  <p> There is no thought or emotion you can experience that does not affect the body in some way.</p>
  <p> That is why care must be taken to see yourself in the best possible way.</p>
  <p> With the power of a visualization, you can rearrange the atoms in your body to produce a healthy condition or an ill condition.</p>
  <p> It depends on how you see and program yourself.</p>
  <p> When you see yourself in a better light, and program yourself with positive self-talk, you automatically transfer the benefits to your body and mind.</p>
  <p> When you begin feeling better, give yourself credit.</p>
  <p> Congratulate yourself and thank the Lord for your better feelings.</p>
  <p> Gratitude is a large part of continuing to feel better about yourself.</p>
  <p> You create your own reality.</p>
  <p> After all, if you think things happen by chance, how can you be responsible for what happens to you?</p>
  <p> If you have a low self-image and don’t like yourself, how can your body produce a perfectly healthy structure?</p>
  <p> How can you fulfill in your body what you’re not thinking in your mind?</p>
  <p> Many people take the stance: "I’m not going to be sick today, I don't have time for it", and go through life without any maladies?</p>
  <p> Conscious choice and will power do make a difference, so tune into yourself and make good choices.</p>
  <p> You can consciously manipulate your cellular structure through the power of your thoughts.</p>
  <p> You can visualize the ailment diminishing and diminishing until finally the excretory system carries it away.</p>
  <p> By imagining the process, you complete the connection between your mind and your body.</p>
  <p> Of course, the prayers of others can also help to resonate the process to make the metamorphosis more complete.</p>
  <p> In the East, yogis and lamas perform similar visualizations to achieve the same result.</p>
  <p> They may even add to the process by vibrating their inner tissues with a chant, like the sound, 'Aum-m-m.'</p>
  <p> Any number of visualizations can be created to combat and conquer internal disorders and disease.</p>
  <p> Imagining a swarm of healthy and powerful white blood cells (sharks) doing battle and eliminating the unhealthy disease cell (weak little fish) has worked for many people.</p>
  <p> Visualizing a funnel of white energy swirling over a troublesome spot has worked as well.</p>
  <p> Verbalizing and affirming to yourself what you want healed, and then allowing the body to complete the task with an open receptivity to the process is also good.</p>
  <p> When you have an ache or a pain, it’s the body’s signal to you that an area of the body needs addressing.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, bring your conscious awareness to the painful location and dwell on the area for a while.</p>
  <p> The connected mind of those cells has to respond to your healing, soothing, energizing thoughts.</p>
  <p> As you learned in “<a href="HS/E107.html">Exercise 107 - Electromagnetic Field Awareness</a>,” your blood volume increases markedly in an area of the body you are consciously thinking about, and with the blood also comes helpful body chemicals and ailment-fighting antibodies and leucocytes.</p>
  <p> Stay mindful and focused on the painful area and feel it respond.</p>
  <p> Talk to the area and discuss what you want to take place there.</p>
  <p> This process often relieves emotional blocks that are tied to the cells there.</p>
  <p> It's good preventive practice to give yourself a nightly visualization/affirmation for all your bodily parts to heal and repair themselves.</p>
  <p> Do this while consciously bringing your awareness to each area of the body in a methodical, relaxed way, and holding it there for several seconds.</p>
  <p> Unfulfilled needs create chaos and imbalance.</p>
  <p> Our bodies suffer.</p>
  <p> It often only takes a few minutes to make time for what we need to do in our lives.</p>
  <p> Yet it's easy to become out of touch with our bodies and our health.</p>
  <p> Most people want a pill or injection to “fix” them because they’ve been told that that is the way to treat most disorders.</p>
  <p> If they were told that they had to think differently or have a more positive attitude towards themselves, they might not understand the process.</p>
  <p> Whatever your behavioral patterns are, if you do the same thing throughout your life, you’ll get the same result.</p>
  <p> When you change what you are doing, saying and thinking about yourself, you change the result you get afterwards.</p>
