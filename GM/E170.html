  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 170 </p><h1>Finding Things or People With Intuition</h1>
  <p> You can help to develop your intuition by exercising and applying common sense in your daily life.</p>
  <p> Adopt a calm and peaceful nature.</p>
  <p> Maintain a depth of thought and a focus on a continued activity in a singular direction.</p>
  <p> Devote yourself to daily introspection and analysis, and most of all, meditate and hold on to the serene aftereffects of meditation to create an intuitive state.</p>
  <p> When in a big city, almost everyone has had the experience of looking for a parking place in a congested area.</p>
  <p> Instead of cursing the situation and creating negative thought impressions, quietly ask yourself in which direction is the nearest parking space.</p>
  <p> When you get the hang of this exercise, the question turns into a knowingness and you just automatically 'home' in on the right street.</p>
  <p> You start 'listening' to your feelings as to where to go.</p>
  <p> There is a kind of an indicator off the skirt of your mind, and it's not so much in the trying as it is in the doing.</p>
  <p> Follow your initial impressions and urges as to where to look.</p>
  <p> Let your intuition be your guide and accept the fact that you CAN do it.</p>
  <p> You can use the same basic technique in looking for lost or misplaced items or a friend in a crowd.</p>
  <p> Let yourself be internally guided.</p>
  <p> As you practice this exercise, you will notice that certain kinds of intuitive impressions are more productive than others.</p>
