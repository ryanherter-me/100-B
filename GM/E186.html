  <p>GENERAL MIND STIMULATION </p><p> Exercise 186 </p><h1>Distant Examinations</h1>
  <p> Diagnosing and examining people from a distance is a form of mental projection.</p>
  <p> Some doctors have learned to not only diagnose a clothed patient intuitively, but also to precognitively see the course of a patient's disease stretching out in the future ahead of him.</p>
  <p> For this exercise, work with a partner until you become proficient.</p>
  <p> Then afterwards, you can work on your own.</p>
  <p> Assume a self-hypnotic state (review "<a href="GM/E176.html">Exercise 176 - Learning Self-Hypnosis</a>") and tell your partner when you have achieved it.</p>
  <p> Now have your partner tell you the full name, address, age and sex of a person that he knows very well, but that you don't know at all.</p>
  <p> Now visualize this person in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Let your partner guide you by asking you questions about the subject.</p>
  <p> Do you perceive any abnormalities or unhealthy conditions present in the subject?</p>
  <p> Scan the body from head to toe and pick out any areas that attract your attention.</p>
  <p> First impressions are important, so speak up when you see something.</p>
  <p> Your partner should also remember only to give you positive feedback regarding your successful "hits."</p>
  <p> In other words, if you perceive a trouble spot in the leg and the subject recently fractured his leg, have your partner say, "That's correct!"</p>
  <p> If there was no trouble with the leg to his knowledge, simply have your partner say, "I have no information regarding that area."</p>
  <p> Imagine yourself entering into the subject's body (review "<a href="GM/E206.html">Exercise 206 - Role Taking As An Actor</a>") and experiencing what it feels like.</p>
  <p> How much does the subject weigh?</p>
  <p> How tall is the subject?</p>
  <p> Does the subject wear glasses?</p>
  <p> Does the subject smoke?</p>
  <p> What is the subject's personality like?</p>
  <p> Have your partner tell you when you score a hit, but instruct your partner only to say, "I have no information regarding that area," when he thinks you are wrong.</p>
  <p> Many times later on, your partner may learn that you were indeed correct on some area that he thought you were wrong on before.</p>
  <p> In any event, a positive encouraging air is better for your reception that a negative one.</p>
  <p> Also, only do this exercise with the air of helping people, not hindering them.</p>
  <p> As you practice, you will get more and more accurate.</p>
  <p> Eventually, you will be able to 'call up' the image of anyone for examination and ask your inner self where any problems lie.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, you can visualize yourself soothing and healing the affected area.</p>
  <p> Any energies directed in this way are of benefit (review "<a href="GM/E147.html">Exercise 147 - Sending Energy To Someone</a>").</p>
  <p> In concluding this exercise, you can come out of the self-hypnotic state by simply suggesting to yourself that you will progressively awaken as you count backwards from 10 -1.</p>
  <p> As a variation to this exercise, have your partner visualize the person to be examined.</p>
  <p> As your partner holds onto this visualization in his mind, dangle a pendulum (review "<a href="GM/E204.html">Exercise 204 - Divining, Dowsing and Radiesthesia</a>") over an anatomical chart of Homo sapiens, working from the head to the toes slowly.</p>
  <p> When the pendulum begins to circle, ask your partner about that area of the body.</p>
  <p> The clearer your partner's visualization of the subject, the better your success at diagnosis will be.</p>
  <p> Have your partner verbally respond in the same fashion as in the preceding paragraph.</p>
