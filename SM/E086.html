  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 86 </p><h1>Learning Foreign Vocabulary</h1>
  <p> As an exercise, type a list of foreign vocabulary words in capital letters with their English equivalents alongside them.</p>
  <p> Now turn the page upside down and hold it in the left field of vision.</p>
  <p> Read the foreign vocabulary aloud in this position with their English counterparts.</p>
  <p> Using all capital letters allows the brain less confusion in deciphering the upside down shape of the words.</p>
  <p> Holding the page in the left field of vision projects the images to the right brain.</p>
  <p> The right brain is the acknowledger of upside down, mirror and backwards-type language.</p>
  <p> It is also the primary avenue to the storage area of long term memories.</p>
  <p> Hence by directing your memorization process to that side of the brain first, the number of repetitions to learn the vocabulary is greatly reduced.</p>
  <p> Singing or saying the vocabulary with intonation does the same thing.</p>
  <p> As another exercise, choose nouns that depict objects, animals or tangible things.</p>
  <p> Now create a mental image of the item in a blown-up or exaggerated form and print the letters in large print across the item.</p>
  <p> For instance, the Spanish word for bed is 'cama'.</p>
  <p>Visualize a bed leaning against a wall with its end side up and the letters C A - M - A printed across it in bold capital letters.</p>
