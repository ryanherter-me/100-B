  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 85 </p><h1>Using Sensory Learning Links</h1>
  <p> Research has shown that if you learn something while drunk, it will be better remembered when you are inebriated again.</p>
  <p> State related memory links can often assist your learning capacity.</p>
  <p> For instance, learning something in a certain seat or in a certain posture represents a kinesthetic linked state.</p>
  <p> When tested later in the same seat or with the same posture, scores are higher than when tested in an alternative seat or posture.</p>
  <p> Research has also revealed that odors can not only evoke long forgotten memories, but they can serve as definite learning links.</p>
  <p> In controlled experiments, students that learned something while in the presence of a certain odor remembered that same information better when in the midst of that same odor again.</p>
  <p> The more unique the aroma, the better.</p>
  <p> When learning foreign vocabulary, seeing the words to be learned is visual input.</p>
  <p> Hearing them is auditory input, and this doubles the sensory input to the brain.</p>
  <p> If you choose words that are represented by odors, you have a third pathway to the brain.</p>
  <p> Olfactory impulses travel a shorter, more direct route to your brain than do visual or auditory messages, and they do not criss cross like other neural connections on each side of your body.</p>
  <p> When foreign vocabulary and odors are presented together, word lists are retained more easily.</p>
  <p> For example, smell the odor of cheese as you learn the Spanish word 'queso.'</p>
  <p> Smell various fruits, spices and flowers while simultaneously reiterating aloud their foreign word equivalents.</p>
  <p> Now touch and hold various objects, fruits or animals as you learn their equivalent foreign word.</p>
  <p> Now taste certain fruits, vegetables and foods as you associate their foreign word equivalents.</p>
  <p> Kinesthetically act out appropriate words in descriptive pantomime, and let the motor movements assist in establishing associative, memory patterns.</p>
  <p> In the absence of actual physical stimuli, simply visualize tasting, smelling and touching various items while saying aloud the appropriate foreign word (review "<a href="HS/E094.html">Exercise 94 - Imagining Your Senses</a>").</p>
  <p> This visualization process will reinforce your memory process when you are unable to physically make the associations with your senses.</p>
