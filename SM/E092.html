  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 92 </p><h1>61-Hour Language Immersion</h1>
  <p> The term brainwashing was coined with bad connotations during the Korean War.</p>
  <p> When American soldiers were captured and subjected to an incessant, behavioral modifying treatment without sleep, their political ideologies were altered and their minds were turned against their countrymen.</p>
  <p> As cruel as such treatment seemed, it opened up gateways to a more thorough understanding of the brain's functioning.</p>
  <p> By fatiguing, confusing and quieting the left brain's conscious, analytical process, the receptive right hemisphere could absorb material subjected to it with little difficulty -- like feeding an organic computer.</p>
  <p> In one total immersion experiment, Spanish was taught to a male student in 61 hours!</p>
  <p> The student was kept awake during the entire 61-hour period with only 10 minute pauses every hour.</p>
  <p> During this process, he was bombarded with instructions and questions by five Spanish teachers who worked in shifts.</p>
  <p> The theory was that if a man could be kept awake long enough, his brain would become so tired that he couldn't think.</p>
  <p> Not thinking, he couldn't analyze, and therefore whatever he heard, he'd absorb and retain, the experimenters reasoned.</p>
  <p> After 12 hours, the student had mastered a Spanish vocabulary of 1,000 words (twice as much Spanish as a student would normally get in 4 hours a week for 3 weeks).</p>
  <p> By the 44th hour, the student faded.</p>
  <p> He was too tired to think.</p>
  <p> He stopped translating Spanish into English to understand the meaning.</p>
  <p> For the remaining hours, he talked to the instructors completely in Spanish.</p>
  <p> The student suffered no after affects, remembered his speaking vocabulary quite well and never once felt like he was being brainwashed throughout the whole experiment.</p>
  <p> For this exercise, do not participate as a student or instructor if there are any medical reasons for you not to do so.</p>
  <p> Select 3 to 6 instructors that are willing to rotate in 2 to 6 hour shifts and coordinate accordingly.</p>
  <p> Have the instructors agree ahead of time on the language material and the time period, but have a continuous flow of foreign language instruction bombarding you for 61 hours or longer.</p>
  <p> Adhere to the 10 minute toilet and food breaks, but allow yourself no snoozing.</p>
  <p> This technique is especially effective when the instructors are creative and use various memory methods during the immersion process.</p>
  <p> For instance, if an instructor personally pantomimes the action that a foreign word represents, and the student replicates this kinesthetic action, retention will be enhanced by this more involved association.</p>
  <p> Smelling items represented by foreign words also improves recall.</p>
  <p> Even reiterating foreign words at the bottom of the bounce while bouncing on a mini-trampoline increases recall later due to the G-force contribution upon the brain cells.</p>
  <p> Also by teaching science, art, math or other subject matter, you can create meaningfulness to the language learning.</p>
  <p> Singing with intonation, writing foreign words on the blackboard in mirror language or upside down or using the 4-second rhythmic method with 60 beats per minute Baroque music in the background (see "<a href="/SM/E083.html">Exercise 83 - Rhythmic Memorizing</a>") can all assist in the immersion learning process.</p>
