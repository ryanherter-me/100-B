  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 79 </p><h1>Ridiculous Associations</h1>
  <p> Which is better for remembering something, to allow your memory to inadvertently make its own associative patterns, or to consciously create your own memory associations?</p>
  <p> Associative patterns are the unique binding factors in memory.</p>
  <p> Great writers of fiction have the marvelous ability to have you automatically create internal visualizations when you read their words.</p>
  <p> To remember facts, speeches, conversations or magazine articles, you can learn to create these internal images for yourself.</p>
  <p> Your memory can become powerful by creating exaggerated, ridiculous images, sounds or feelings involving wild, outlandish or sexually oriented material in your associations.</p>
  <p> For example, to remember a short grocery store list -- tuna fish, celery, beans and bread - create the mental image of a tuna with celery stalks sticking out of its gills swimming on a slice of bread and defecating beans from its anus.</p>
  <p> Now memorize the following list of 12 words in the next 2 minutes using ridiculous, associative patterns (including action and sensory oriented ones), and keep the words in the arrangement that they are presented.</p>
  <p> Connect your associations so that you have 4 mental pictures of 3 words each.</p>
  <p> Then cover them up and write them down on a sheet of paper.</p>
  <p> For an example, you could visualize an angry snail jumping up and down in the snow for the first group of 3 words.</p>
  <p> 1) TEMPER SNAIL SNOW</p>
  <p> 2) LEOPARD CAMPER ARTERY</p>
  <p> 3) MOUNTAIN MIDGET STAR</p>
  <p> 4) LAKE LIGHT DOOR</p>
  <p> If you remembered all the words from the previous group, but had trouble remembering their exact order, simply stack each visualized group of three, one upon the other.</p>
  <p> For instance, the previous 12 words could have been remembered in this way: First, visualize a sloping incline going upwards.</p>
  <p> Then imagine an angry snail jumping up and down in the snow at the bottom; followed by a leopard pulling out the arteries of a camper while sitting on a ledge above the snail, followed by a midget climbing up the slope of a mountain chasing a small darting star; and at the top is a mountain lake displaying a bright luminescent light with a giant book floating in the middle of it.</p>
  <p> With this group of words, memorize them by using contrasting and absurd color combinations in your visualizations.</p>
  <p> For example, for the first group of three, you could visualize a large red polka dotted coin sticking out of the mouth of a blue monkey sitting on a giant yellow striped letter.</p>
  <p> 1) COIN MONKEY LETTER</p>
  <p> 2) CENTER BUILDING MEAT</p>
  <p> 3) KEY HALO TEACHER</p>
  <p> 4) DOOR FISH CLOUD To remember the following chores for the day by stacking,||</p>
  <p> 1) Purchase a ham, a flashlight and a mousetrap.</p>
  <p> 2) Pay your phone bill.</p>
  <p> 3) Get fuel for the oil burner.</p>
  <p> 4) Send your mother a birthday card.</p>
  <p> You could create a image of a ham with a flashlight blinking on and off sticking out of the top of the ham; and a mousetrap snapped shut on top of the flashlight; then a ringing phone on top of the mousetrap and its cord wrapped around the mousetrap; then a spouting, miniature oil derrick on top of the phone; and your mother sitting on the spouting oil reading your card.</p>
  <p> One further note: There is clear evidence that memories are very state dependent.</p>
  <p> If you are happy, fearful, listening to music, drunk, smoking or positioned in a favorite chair when learning something, the memory of that same something will be better recalled when you are in that same state again.</p>
  <p> It appears that linkages with emotion and sensory involvement bring about associative connections to further your recall.</p>
  <p> Since oftentimes it is not feasible to recreate a particular state in reality, it can nevertheless be accomplished through visualizing that same state internally.</p>
  <p> Now apply these principles to your own learning material, and create ridiculous associative visualizations for better recall.</p>
  <p> Personalize your ridiculous associations in some way with all your material to be remembered.</p>
