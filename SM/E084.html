  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 84 </p><h1>Observational Recall</h1>
  <p> To train a ninja assassin to observe the enemy and to obtain as much useful and specific information as possible, the ancient masters devised a "game of stones.</p>
  <p> Use a small wooden box or shallow wicker tray and place in it stones, jewelry, silverware, keys, coins and small household items so that the bottom is completely covered.</p>
  <p> Now expose to a partner the uncovered container in front of your.</p>
  <p> Now have him look at the items as long as desired and even touch and feel them.</p>
  <p> After he sufficiently examines them, cover the container and have him relate what was see.</p>
  <p> Check for accuracy and take time in referring to the ones he missed.</p>
  <p> Now cover the box and have him reiterate once again everything that he saw.</p>
  <p> This time also ask him to relate details about the container!</p>
  <p> This teaches him not to be so absorbed in detail that the overall picture is obscured.</p>
  <p> Repeat the game until observation improves to 100%.</p>
  <p> A college professor demonstrated to his freshman classroom the lack of observational awareness in most people by staging a sham murder.</p>
  <p> As he began his class, a thin, small busted, white woman (5'11") in a T-shirt and jeans, wearing a baseball cap over short hair burst into the room and shouted, "This is a joke.</p>
  <p> She carried a bow and quiver, but shot the professor with a blank pistol one time.</p>
  <p> She dropped the bow and quiver, and quickly left the room as the professor slumped to the floor.</p>
  <p> Through the classroom pandemonium, the professor arose from the floor seconds later, and visibly removed a mock arrow from a pretended wound in the side.</p>
  <p> After calming the class, he instructed them to write down the answers to the following questions:</p>
  <p> 1) What did the assailant say?</p>
  <p> 2) What was the assailant wearing?</p>
  <p> 3) Describe the assailant -- male or female, black or white, short hair or long, fat or thin, tall or short, etc.</p>
  <p> 4) What action did the assailant take?</p>
  <p> Astonishingly, there was very little, accurate agreement among the classroom students.</p>
  <p> Eyewitnesses to crimes are often just as unreliable.</p>
