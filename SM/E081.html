  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 81 </p><h1>Concentration & Eidetic Imagery</h1>
  <p> When the brain surgeon, Dr. Wilder Penfield stimulated certain brain cells with electrodes, long forgotten conversations, songs, jokes and childhood memories were evoked from his patients.</p>
  <p> If your brain registers everything that pours into your senses, then you should learn how to elicit that information from your brain's storehouse.</p>
  <p> Certain concentration skills can be learned to help initiate this process.</p>
  <p> As a practice exercise, obtain and arrange the following materials.</p>
  <p> Cut a 15" X 15" square of black construction paper and paste a white 6" X 6" square in the center of it.</p>
  <p> Attach this paper arrangement to a light colored wall at about eye level (when seated in a chair).</p>
  <p> Seat yourself about 3 feet away and get in a comfortable, relaxed position.</p>
  <p> Close your eyes and for a couple of minutes, visualize a giant blackboard in your mind.</p>
  <p> Let distracting images pass on by, but keep your blackboard clear.</p>
  <p> Now open your eyes and gaze at the center of the square for 2 or 3 minutes.</p>
  <p> Move your eyes to a spot on the wall alongside the paper pattern and observe the after-image.</p>
  <p> When it starts to fade, imagine it is still there.</p>
  <p> Now close your eyes and recreate the whole pattern in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Keep it as steady as possible on your mental blackboard.</p>
  <p> Repeat the procedure 2 more times.</p>
  <p> As a variation of the above exercise, cut a 15" X 15" square of black construction paper and paste a white 10" wide 5-pointed star in the center of it.</p>
  <p> Repeat the same gazing and visualizing procedure as before.</p>
  <p> Now visualize zooming in on the star to within a close proximity of it.</p>
  <p> Now zoom out to a point where it is very small.</p>
  <p> Repeat this process 2 more times; then see it back to normal size again.</p>
  <p> Now view it upside down in your mind's eye; then slowly rotate your perspective in a circular motion around it.</p>
  <p> Then reverse your rotational perspective and circle around it the other way.</p>
  <p> Practice with other forms, pictures and objects and increase your eidetic imaging skills.</p>
  <p> 134 SUPER MEMORY As a further exercise, cut a 15" X 15" square of white construction paper and paste a 6" diameter circle of sky blue paper in the middle.</p>
  <p> Attach it to the wall at about eye level, and seat yourself in a relaxed position about 3 feet away.</p>
  <p> With closed eyes, visualize your mental blackboard.</p>
  <p> Now open your eyes and look at the blue circle.</p>
  <p> Mentally zoom in towards the circle and then back out again.</p>
  <p> Repeat several times.</p>
  <p> Next, while looking at the center of the circle, mentally rotate your conscious awareness around the circle - slowly at first, then faster and faster, then back to a slower revolution, then stop.</p>
  <p> Practice for no more than 10 minutes per day on each exercise, and soon any page in your study book can be reflected onto your mental blackboard for review.</p>
  <p> Eliminate verbalizing (internally or externally) during these exercises, because the formation of eidetic images can be adversely affected.</p>
  <p> Mere after-images are only the initial stages in eidetic imagery, and eventually evolve to more complete visual detail later.</p>
