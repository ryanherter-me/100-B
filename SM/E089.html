  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 89 </p><h1>Remembering Names</h1>
  <p> Normally when people are introduced to other people, there is a rote ritual that they go through like, "This is so and so " and "I am so and so, glad to meet you" etc., and seconds later, neither one remembers the other's name.</p>
  <p> You fumble in the conversation trying to cover up your forgetfulness while you try desperately to recall the name.</p>
  <p> Some people even announce in advance, "I never remember names," almost like a form of bragging; or maybe in an attempt to establish a camaraderie with a host of others who share the same non-admirable trait.</p>
  <p> This also relieves them of the responsibility in their minds of remembering your name, or the name of anyone else they meet.</p>
  <p> Nevertheless, people like hearing their name, and if you remember it, they're flattered and impressed with you more than if you forget it.</p>
  <p> If you consciously keep your wits about you when you're being introduced, you'll find recall much easier.</p>
  <p> For instance, take a few seconds to record and reiterate in your mind the person's name.</p>
  <p> Decide to yourself to remember it.</p>
  <p> Repeat it aloud immediately afterwards, (people love to hear their name repeated) and maybe ask the person how it's spelled.</p>
  <p> Repeat it in your conversation and visualize it written in bold letters on one of the person's body parts -- breasts, head, buttocks, etc.</p>
  <p> Distort the prominent feature of the individual body part to accommodate the letters.</p>
  <p> Be outlandishly creative.</p>
  <p> Perhaps the name itself reminds you of some ridiculous imagery.</p>
  <p> Usually the first part of the name is all that's necessary to create your mental picture.</p>
  <p> For instance, visualize Mr.</p>
  <p> Ashely with his face or body buried in ashes.</p>
  <p> Visualize Mrs. Rosen with roses in her nose, ears and mouth.</p>
  <p> Make an affirmation to yourself right now to remember every name of every person to whom you are introduced.</p>
  <p> Repeat new name associations periodically to yourself throughout the day, and have a mental set ready for new introductions.</p>
  <p> In any social situation, a person considers his name as very important.</p>
  <p> Getting a person's name wrong is perhaps the only thing worse than not remembering it at all.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, use the above technique and memorize the following: 1st manned space flight - Yuri Gagarin - April 12, 1961, on spacecraft Vostok I for 1 hour 48 minutes and 1 orbit.</p>
  <p> 1st woman in space - Valentina V. Tereshkova - June 16 to 19, 1963, on spacecraft Vostok 6 for 70 hours 50 minutes and 48 orbits.</p>
