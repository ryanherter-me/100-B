  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 93 </p><h1>Sleep-Learning</h1>
  <p> The term sleep-learning is slightly deceptive.</p>
  <p> Just before drifting off to sleep at night and again in the morning after coming out of a deep sleep, there is a semiconscious, reverie state of mind when the alpha and theta brain waves are at their optimal output (at 7 to 13 cycles per second and 4 to 6 cycles per second respectively).</p>
  <p> Material recited onto a 12-minute loop tape and played during these time periods is more readily retained than at any other part of the sleep cycle.</p>
  <p> The sleep period where the brain waves are below 4 cycles per second is called the unconscious delta state and the brain wave level above 13 cycles per second is the fully conscious beta state.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, create a 12-minute loop tape with the information that you want to learn.</p>
  <p> Then put it on a timer to be played one hour upon going to sleep and one hour upon awakening.</p>
  <p> For example, with Spanish vocabulary, say the following: "This is your Spanish vocabulary for the night.</p>
  <p> You are relaxed and in a twilight sleep.</p>
  <p> You will remember the following words forever.</p>
  <p> Then read your vocabulary to be learned onto the repeating tape in 4-second intervals as in "<a href="SM/E083.html">Exercise 83 - Rhythmic Memorizing</a>."</p>
  <p> If the material to be learned was recorded at 212 times normal speaking speed with a special tape recorder and still spaced at 4-second intervals, it would increase the bulk to be absorbed (see "<a href="GM/E200.html">Exercise 200 - High Speed Listening</a>").</p>
  <p> Learning in this manner is utilizing the otherwise idle moments during the night.</p>
  <p> One study revealed that sleep-learning improves with time.</p>
  <p> Apparently the brain gets better accustomed to absorption with more practice.</p>
  <p> If you design your tapes with affirmations, you can lose weight, increase your self-confidence, stop smoking or help correct any number of habit patterns while you sleep.</p>
  <p> By directing positive, beneficial thoughts of success, achievement and happiness to the subconscious mind, powerful personality changes can be accomplished while you sleep.</p>
