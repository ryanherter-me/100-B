  <p>SUPER MEMORY </p><p> Exercise 87 </p><h1>Peg System For Numbers</h1>
  <p> Did you ever wonder why some people remember more information than others?</p>
  <p> Most people automatically form various subconscious associations, but if you pay attention and form conscious associative patterns, your memory can improve dramatically.</p>
  <p> Memory experts create mnemonic systems to assist in this conscious, associative process.</p>
  <p> A mnemonic is using some mechanism for associating unknown material with something familiar.</p>
  <p> In so doing, it relieves the burden on your shortterm memory, because your recall can be achieved through association with an already existing memory in long term storage.</p>
  <p> For instance, a simple mnemonic association for remembering the number 1224 is that it is one day before Christmas, 12/25.</p>
  <p> Using a mnemonic system, memory experts can often remember a long series of numbers or even multiple groups of numbers.</p>
  <p> One man in the Guiness Book of Records recited pi from memory to 40,000 places in 1987.</p>
  <p> To improve your own memory with numbers, the following mnemonic system can be easily learned.</p>
  <p> Numbers can be remembered easier by being converted to letters, so learn the corresponding memory pegs that are arranged as follows: DIGITS 1 2 3 4 5 LETTERS T OR D N M R L 6 7 8 J, CH, SH or soft G K, hard C, or hard G F, PH, V 9 P or B 0 soft C, S, Z REASONS There is 1 downstroke in a small t.</p>
  <p> There are 2 downstrokes in a small n.</p>
  <p> There are 3 downstrokes in a small m.</p>
  <p> The fourth letter of the word four is R.</p>
  <p> Your 5 fingers, with thumb extended forms an L.</p>
  <p> The Roman capital L stands for 50.</p>
  <p> The letter J turned around is almost like a 6.</p>
  <p> Moving two 7's around forms a K.</p>
  <p> A script written F looks like an 8.</p>
  <p> Also picture a figure skater gliding on the ice in a figure 8.</p>
  <p> A 9 is the mirror image of a P.</p>
  <p> A lower case b is an upside down 9.</p>
  <p> The final digit, 0, is also the final letter in the alphabet, Z.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, whenever you have a spare moment, think of a telephone or other number and convert it into letters.</p>
  <p> Now add vowels and create words or phrases.</p>
  <p> Soon you will be able to convert any number into a word or a phrase with ease and back again automatically.</p>
  <p> Now use ridiculous associations between the words to create imaginary scenes.</p>
