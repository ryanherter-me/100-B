  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 7 </p><h1>Relaxation For Improved Awareness</h1>
  <p> Deep relaxation relieves tension & fear, and strengthens the immune response to disease.</p>
  <p> By relaxing your body, your mind becomes calm and clear while your brain wave activity is slowed to the alpha state (7 to 14 cycles per second).</p>
  <p> You can create your own relaxation cassette tape or have someone read the following relaxation dialogue to you or you can mentally and progressively repeat the following points to yourself.</p>
  <p> To begin, assume a comfortable, seated or reclined position.</p>
  <p> Now close your eyes, and take several easy, deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> When you inhale, say to yourself, "I am," and as you exhale, say to yourself, "relaxed."</p>
  <p> Now starting with your toes and feet, bring your conscious awareness to each foot, and flex and relax each one individually.</p>
  <p> Say to yourself, "In every way I am feeling better and more relaxed."</p>
  <p> Now move up to each leg and flex and relax each leg.</p>
  <p> Now be aware of your buttocks.</p>
  <p> Flex and relax your buttocks.</p>
  <p> Now bring your conscious awareness to your abdomen and stomach areas.</p>
  <p> Feel those areas flexing and relaxing.</p>
  <p> Now focus attention to your back area.</p>
  <p> Flex and relax it.</p>
  <p> Now flex and relax your chest area.</p>
  <p> Now flex and relax each hand and arm.</p>
  <p> Feel the sensation of your shoulders flexing and relaxing.</p>
  <p> Feel your neck muscles relaxing and becoming soft and heavy.</p>
  <p> Be aware of and feel the muscles in your mouth, nose and eyes relaxing.</p>
  <p> Let your jaw become loose and let your tongue drop.</p>
  <p> Now direct all the muscles of your head to relax.</p>
  <p> Imagine a warm heaviness spreading throughout your body.</p>
  <p> Now while continuing the easy abdominal breathing, scan the entire body for any tension and relax it.</p>
  <p> Now say to yourself, "I am in complete control of all my faculties, and can achieve relaxation whenever I desire.</p>
  <p> I am now fully relaxed."</p>
  <p> In this totally relaxed state, your blood vessels are dilated, and more oxygenated blood is flowing to your vital brain areas for better functioning.</p>
  <p> Now begin imagining a specific color in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> With each abdominal breath, you are breathing in that color of relaxation.</p>
  <p> Allow it to permeate and soothe all the cells of your body with each breath that you take.</p>
  <p> The color you have chosen to connect with your state of relaxation will be the same color you can use in the future to help you relax.</p>
  <p> Now create the number 3 on your mental blackboard in that same color, and touch the tip of your forefinger with your thumb as you breathe a sigh of complete relaxation.</p>
  <p> Whenever you notice that you are tense or anxious in the future, you need only close your eyes for a few moments, breathe deeply, & imagine the color you chose flowing through your nostrils; or visualize the colored number 3 on your mental blackboard; or simply touch the tip of your forefinger with your thumb to achieve the state of total relaxation (review “<a href="/EM/E002.html">Exercise 2 - Anchoring Positive States of Mind</a>”).</p>
  <p> To be aware of your tension throughout the day, and to be able to relax whenever and wherever you are is important.</p>
  <p> Now that you know how to relax, frequent scanning of your body throughout your normal day can target areas needing relaxation.</p>
  <p> You can also facilitate a quicker relief of anxiety in the future by remembering to breath deeply, center your posture and focus your attention on what is going on around you.</p>
  <p> Most worrisome anxiety is simply an internal extension of yourself in the imagined future.</p>
  <p> Becoming aware of the here and now (environmental sounds, colors, smells, etc.) keeps your focus on the reality of the present.</p>
