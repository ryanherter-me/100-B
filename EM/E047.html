  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 47 </p><h1>Eye Contact For Inner Communication</h1>
  <p> Just as microwaves can act as harmonically compatible carrier beams for extremely low frequency (ELF) wavelengths, focused eye beams can carry the emotional intentions of their transmitter.</p>
  <p> Couples in love can sometimes exchange complete emotional dialogues with one another through their eyes alone.</p>
  <p> Much of what you perceive through your eyes is a matter of interpretation in the brain.</p>
  <p> In "Exercise -Experiencing Another Person's Senses," you learned that other people often perceive things differently than you do.</p>
  <p> What you perceive can also be distorted by a telepathic message (see "<a href="GM/E188.html">Exercise 188 - Visual Telepathy</a>"), or by the suggestive message of a hypnotist - hence the fear of the 'hypnotic eye.'</p>
  <p> There is a strange energy that streams forth from your eyes.</p>
  <p> You can "intuitively" perceive it at times when someone with an emotional intention is staring at you.</p>
  <p> You instinctively look away because of it when you don't want to be noticed, or when you don't want your true thoughts to be known in a conversation.</p>
  <p> The so-called 'stage fright' of public speakers and would-be actors might have a lot to do with the sudden impact of everyone's eye beams carrying various thoughts that wallop a speaker into a subconscious stupor.</p>
  <p> This also often happens when you're introduced to someone and their eye beam meets yours, and their name never really gets registered and remembered properly.</p>
  <p> By consciously learning to screen out and adjust to this subliminal 'mental noise,' you gain more self-control in such situations.</p>
  <p> Because of this energy, it is said that ninja assassins used to look at their target victims with their peripheral vision so as not to give their position away.</p>
  <p> Electromagnetic energy radiates from your body, but a focalized form of ELF energy is guided by your eye beam (see "<a href="GM/E214.html">Exercise 214 - Psionic and Psychotronic Generators</a>").</p>
  <p> Psychokinetic demonstrations are greatly assisted by a concentrated stare from the eyes (see "<a href="GM/E195.html">Exercise 195 - Psychokinesis</a>").</p>
  <p> Benedetto Supino of Italy was reported to have the unusual ability of staring at paper, plastic or wooden objects, and causing such material to burst into flames!</p>
  <p> Unusual reports are sometimes heard of Chinese children with X-ray eyes, or others that can bend metal with a concentrated stare.</p>
  <p> Many people are fearful of prolonged eye contact with other people.</p>
  <p> Since thought transmissions through the eyes are a two-way street, fear often results when a person feels another person might be seeing into their mind to read through their external facade - hence the expression, "The eyes are the windows of the soul."</p>
  <p> In most social situations, each person has a length of time where eye contact feels com- fortable.</p>
  <p> Anything beyond this period of time, it tends to become uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> Eye contact between two people usually varies anywhere from split seconds to about 10 seconds in duration.</p>
  <p> Listeners tend to maintain eye contact more than speakers.</p>
  <p> Listeners usually look away when they are about to speak, and speakers usually have a relatively prolonged gaze when they are about to finish speaking.</p>
  <p> Did you ever meet a strange barking dog only to have him back away when your eyes met his?</p>
  <p> Primate researchers have learned the same thing happens with wild monkeys.</p>
  <p> If you look briefly into their eyes, they won't hold their ground when you approach them.</p>
  <p> However if you carefully avoid eye contact, you can come within 5 feet of them.</p>
  <p> The next time you have a group gathered together, do the following experiment.</p>
  <p> Blindfold 2 people and have everyone else in the group only look at the face of one of the two people with some kind of emotional or intentional thought in mind.</p>
  <p> After about 1 minute of silence.</p>
  <p> Ask the 2 volunteers if they thought that they were the one being stared at, and what thought impressions did they have.</p>
  <p> Now relax and sit across from a partner.</p>
  <p> Begin by silently looking into each other's eyes.</p>
  <p> While in a relaxed frame of mind, look into his (her) right eye, then into the left eye.</p>
  <p> Extend your conscious awareness outside of yourself and "touch" the other person's mind through the pathway of his (her) eye beam.</p>
  <p> "Listen" with your intuition instead of your ears.</p>
  <p> Dispel any tension you might have over this, for this is only meant as a mutual and volitional exchange.</p>
  <p> Take note of any pictures, impressions, feelings or verbal messages that you perceive.</p>
  <p> Sometimes whole dialogues can be exchanged through a mutual perception in this way.</p>
  <p> Then after 2 minutes, check off the adjectives on the Adjectival Evaluation Sheet following this exercise that you think might be appropriate to your partner's personality.</p>
  <p> Also find out from your partner whether any strong impressions you picked up were really pertinent to your partner or not.</p>
  <p> As an added experiment, put on a pair of reflective sunglasses and observe the difference in eye contact this way.</p>
  <p> See if your partner can tell when you are focused on him (her), and when your eyes are shifted away from him (her).</p>
  <p> Afterwards, switch your roles.</p>
  <p> Rarely do people really get to know one another very well.</p>
  <p> Usually a lot of nonverbal communication can be felt by looking into someone's eyes.</p>
  <p> Any initial anger, fear or anxiety can quickly dissipate into peace and a relief-type relaxation with prolonged eye contact.</p>
  <p> With the tensions relieved, your energy is once again available for use.</p>
  <p> With practice, an understanding and oneness in the presence of other human beings can replace the fear and misunderstanding so often experienced.</p>
  <p> ADJECTIVAL EVALUATION SHEET Check off those words & phrases you feel are applicable to your partner: argumentative shrewd materialistic stuffy diplomatic vindictive insecure confident insensitive easily angered jovial trivial selfish unselfish aggressive timid intelligence average friendly intelligence high quick witted talkative adventurous cautious patient impatient erotic contemplative intense caring giving submissive deceptive trustworthy untrustworthy disciplined undisciplined lazy minded dangerous materialistic peaceful close-minded devious efficient independent critical childish unstable thoughtful boisterous inquisitive curious tolerant intolerant restrictive domineering secure dishonest honest knowledgeable skillful quick learner interesting agreeable intriguing logical illogical emotionally stable nervous creative healthy unhealthy loving assertive a leader type understanding candid fearful stubborn frugal wasteful helpful sloppy compassionate sympathetic polite open-minded disagreeable If there are any words you feel you would like to add to the list for your description, please do so.</p>
