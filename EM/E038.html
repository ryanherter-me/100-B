  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 38 </p><h1>Swaying A Person Your Way</h1>
  <p> Nobody does anything in this world that he doesn't want to do.</p>
  <p> In swaying a person your way, the point is NOT to get someone to do something against his will, but instead to get him to WANT to do it.</p>
  <p> In this way, no resentment is built up and respect and cooperation are your rewards.</p>
  <p> As a daily exercise, apply the following techniques to deal more successfully with people:</p>
  <p> 1) Get the other person talking about himself, family or possessions.</p>
  <p> 2) Put the other person in a yes saying mood by giving him a lot of other things he can say yes to first.</p>
  <p> 3) Give the other person a feeling of importance by seeking their advice.</p>
  <p> 4) Get the other person thinking about how the job can be done, so it removes any question in his mind as to whether it should be done.</p>
  <p> 5) Give the other person a choice between 2 alternatives, both of which lead to your goal.</p>
  <p> 6) Arrange it so that the person will benefit highly by changing to your position.</p>
  <p> 7) Always express appreciation and thankfulness to the people that have impressed you with their contribution.</p>
  <p> 8) Smile and use the appropriate body language (see "<a href="GM/E209.html">Exercise 209 - Discerning Body Language</a>") that announces that you like the other person.</p>
  <p> 9) Imagine the other person is the ideal companion for you and that you like him tremendously (even if you thought you disliked him).</p>
  <p> When you assume this feeling, you will undergo outward personality changes that the person will notice and be affected by.</p>
  <p> If he doesn't like you initially, he will soon be doing so.</p>
  <p> What do women find most appealing in men?</p>
  <p> Is it good looks, muscles, a macho attitude or money? - maybe, but most of all, it's self-assurance.</p>
  <p> When a man is self-confident, he is comfortable with himself and relaxed around women.</p>
  <p> His eyes don't dart around to every pretty lass that passes by.</p>
  <p> To get a woman to think you're sexy, exude self-confidence; then swaying a woman your way will be no problem.</p>
  <p> If you want to turn women away, act insecure or unsure of yourself.</p>
  <p> Also, since laughing releases endorphins in the brain, making a woman laugh relaxes any tenseness she has and she feels more at ease with you.</p>
  <p> CAUTION:</p>
  <p> To act with an air of self-assurance to harmfully influence women is not the point of this instruction.</p>
  <p> All mannerisms should be genuinely expressed and never as a facade for insecurity.</p>
  <p> If you are already self-confident, display it.</p>
  <p> If you are not, aspire to achieve it.</p>
  <p> To sway a man your way, a woman need only appeal to his macho attitude in some way.</p>
  <p> Very few men are centered enough to withstand an appeal to their male egos.</p>
  <p> In one way or another, if a woman tells a man that he is the best and most fantastic person (or lover) she has ever met, she will have him eating out of the palm of her hand.</p>
  <p> Female spies, prostitutes and manipulative women have often used this tactic over the centuries to their advantage.</p>
  <p> CAUTION:</p>
  <p> Again, it is not the point of this exercise for you to be disingenuous.</p>
  <p> To grow and allow heart felt personality changes to manifest is far preferable to producing them in a phony way.</p>
  <p> To convert an enemy to act as your friend, practice visualizing your enemy acting like your best friend.</p>
  <p> When next you meet, treat him as you would your best friend by acting out the role.</p>
  <p> His attitude has to change in response, and he will probably find himself liking you against his initial inclination!</p>
  <p> Treat everybody as a potential friend and they have to respond.</p>
