  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 6 </p><h1>Positive Affirming, Positive Living</h1>
  <p> What can you accomplish when you imagine, affirm and feel that you can't?</p>
  <p> Images, words and feelings all are part of affirmations.</p>
  <p> Positively expressing that you can do something is a conscious stimulant to the upper cerebral brain regions.</p>
  <p> The more you stimulate and use the upper regions of your brain, the more neural interconnections are made and the more complete your overall brain usage.</p>
  <p> Also, when you are emotionally out of balance, bacterial strains in your body grow more profusely, just like predatory insects attack an unhealthy plant more than a healthy plant!</p>
  <p> Remember the last time you caught a cold?</p>
  <p> Were you unhappy or depressed?</p>
  <p> Was there recently a loss of someone or something, or feelings of guilt just prior to catching it?</p>
  <p> Many bacteria live on the abundant waste substances produced by the thought processes of repressed emotions.</p>
  <p> Research has shown that there is a rapid multiplication of streptococcus bacteria in the throat during emotional stress.</p>
  <p> Fear, worry and internal stress restrict the flow of saliva, and you need saliva to neutralize mouth acids and prevent tooth decay.</p>
  <p> Dental plaque is caused by the bacterium, Streptococcus mutans, which is counteracted to a large extent by the antibodies in your system.</p>
  <p> Your antibody level is increased with an improved immune system.</p>
  <p> Your immune system tends to lower its resistance level in the presence of repressed negativity, and there is a draining of your bodily energy needed to protect you against disorders.</p>
  <p> Many diseases occur when a lowered immune system allows microbes to develop and proliferate.</p>
  <p> Some diseases are initiated right after upsetting events happen or you have a serious bout with depression, worry or loneliness.</p>
  <p> If you understand this, then you must also realize that the self-healing process is largely controlled by your brain -hence the effectiveness of the placebo.</p>
  <p> Just as harmful biochemical changes take place with negative emotions, beneficial changes take place when your thought atmosphere is positive.</p>
  <p> If you don't implant positive thoughts into the subconscious mind, it will draw upon whatever is being played for activation.</p>
  <p> By unconsciously prefacing your daily statements with "I'm afraid that ______" or "I'm worried that ______", you are unintentionally programming your subconscious into an acceptance of unwarranted fear in your life.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, read aloud to yourself the positive affirmations listed below, one at a time -- but read them at least 3 times each.</p>
  <p> Each time, imagine the meaning of the affirmation, and feel what you are affirming is possible in your life.</p>
  <p> If a particular statement is not applicable or acceptable to you, omit it.</p>
  <p> Create other statements more appropriate to your situation.</p>
  <p> Repeat especially appealing statements over and over mentally to yourself throughout the day.</p>
  <p> Feel them, and visualize them manifesting in your life.</p>
  <p> Affirmations have a power to them, because they can change your thoughts and thereby change your reality.</p>
  <p> Since the root of mental and emotional blocks reside in your subconscious thoughts, affirmations are an excellent tool to help you change old mind tapes and programming.</p>
  <p> If you object to the idea of positive affirmations, that's a good signal you need some work in this area.</p>
  <p> In all cases, positive affirmations can help to bring about positive changes in your life.</p>
  <p> Also smile a lot, it's hard to be negative with a smile on your face.</p>
  <p> 1) I am now becoming more productive and efficient in everything that I do.</p>
  <p> 2) I have great purpose, and I am now exercising the unlimited possibilities available to me in the world.</p>
  <p> 3) I am freeing myself now of fear, worry and anxiety, and I am at peace with myself.</p>
  <p> 4) I greatly believe in myself and my abilities, and I am now progressing steadily.</p>
  <p> 5) I am learning and growing daily, and I now find value in each new experience that happens to me.</p>
  <p> 6) I am now directing total health for my entire being and all my bodily cells.</p>
  <p> 7) I am secure now with my home, my work, my family and those around me.</p>
  <p> 8) My attentiveness and observational abilities are now improving every day.</p>
  <p> 9) I am now achieving emotional stability and balance in my life.</p>
  <p> 10) With boldness and confidence, I am now taking action toward my goals.</p>
  <p> 11) I am now taking action toward developing myself every day.</p>
  <p> 12) My physical skills and abilities are now distinctly improving every day in every way.</p>
  <p> 13) I am now achieving my correct body weight, and I am consciously improving my posture every day.</p>
  <p> 14) I now love, forgive and accept myself as I am.</p>
  <p> 15) I am coping, adapting and responding now to changing situations with ease.</p>
  <p> 16) I am prosperous now in all things, and I always have everything I need from God's abundant universe.</p>
  <p> 17) I am progressing constantly now, and I accept full responsibility for everything that happens to me.</p>
  <p> 18) Every day in every way, I am now feeling better about myself and my daily accomplishments.</p>
  <p> 14 ) I am now very youthful, healthy, strong, enthusiastic, happy and full of confident energy.</p>
  <p> 20) I now feel warm and loving and accept everything I create in my life.</p>
  <p> Intensely repeat appealing statements over and over to yourself throughout your day, especially before drifting off to sleep and before climbing out of bed in the morning.</p>
  <p> Write a few affirmations down on a 3" X 5" card to read throughout your day.</p>
  <p> To have more immediate effect with special affirmations of particular importance, you can write some of them down in a notebook 1,000 times, and see how the changes manifest in your life.</p>
  <p> The more frequently you use any affirmations in your daily life, the more likely they will sink into your subconscious and take effect.</p>
  <p> So practice using positive affirmations often.</p>
  <p> As an exercise for tomorrow, positively reinforce all your accomplishments, small or large, with a compliment immediately afterwards.</p>
  <p> To be in a good mood, read positively oriented material, watch positive TV shows, go to motivational seminars, be with positive people and say things to yourself and others in a positive way.</p>
  <p> Avoid any verbal criticism of yourself or others, because the negative atmosphere it creates can only hinder your progress.</p>
  <p> Even your unspoken thought atmosphere toward yourself & others should be kept positive and uncritical for optimal daily results in your life.</p>
  <p> By leading a positive lifestyle, you can look forward to some significant improvements in your life as well as increases in your overall energy level.</p>
