  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 28 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Warming)</h1>
  <p> To demonstrate the suggestibility factor in the mind/body relationship, have an unknowing partner agree to a tolerance to pain test with his back turned towards you.</p>
  <p> Tell him that you want to momentarily touch his back with a lit cigarette to illustrate his control over pain.</p>
  <p> Instead, touch his back with a piece of ice of similar diameter sheathed in a cloth (to prevent water drips) and watch a redness develop on his back.</p>
  <p> This mind/body reaction to the expectation of a suggested result is the basis for many similar hypnotic 'feats' as well.</p>
  <p> Autogenic training allows you to achieve a suggestive state of mind using consciously directed affirmations.</p>
  <p> Once you learn how to interrupt your automatic bodily controls with your conscious mind, you can direct your body to shed excess fat from specific areas, maintain profuse hair growth in balding spots, and heal and repair damaged or diseased cells.</p>
  <p> In fact, youâ€™ll find your body will easily fulfill your conscious suggestions once you learn how to direct it.</p>
  <p> Each autogenic exercise in autonomic control should be mastered before moving on to the next in sequence.</p>
  <p> Right now do one cycle for limb heaviness of the arms and legs.</p>
  <p> It should take you less than a minute.</p>
  <p> Once heaviness is established, begin the exercise for warmth.</p>
  <p> Say to yourself, "My right arm is getting limp and warm," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then repeat, "My right arm is getting warmer and warmer," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "My right arm is completely warm," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "I am feeling completely calm."</p>
  <p> Using your imagination, actually feel your arm getting warm.</p>
  <p> Remember a time in the sun when it really was warm or actually go into the sun and remind yourself how it feels.</p>
  <p> Actually sustaining your conscious awareness in a certain body area will automatically bring a blood flow to that body area and an accompanying warmth at the same time, so you should master this exercise quite easily.</p>
  <p> Repeat the procedure 2 to 3 times a day for 3 days.</p>
  <p> Then do the left arm, both arms, right leg, left leg, both legs and then both arms and legs for 3 days on each sequence.</p>
  <p> Then sum up the first two exercises in a combined fashion.</p>
  <p> Say, "My arms and legs are getting limp and heavy and warm," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then repeat, "My arms and legs are getting heavier and warmer," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "I feel completely calm."</p>
  <p> Always before repeating a cycle, open your eyes and throw off the heaviness and warmth.</p>
  <p> Then repeat the process again.</p>
  <p> Only begin the warmth formula after the limb feels heavy.</p>
