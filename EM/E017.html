  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 17 </p><h1>Concentration To Relieve Stress</h1>
  <p> When you choose to replay negative thought patterns during your normal day, it often keeps you in a negative state.</p>
  <p> A simple exercise in concentration can do wonders in breaking a negative condition, and it can also give you immediate relief!</p>
  <p> Choose an object, a geometric design, a picture or a candle flame, and while in a relaxed position, direct your TOTAL conscious awareness toward observing it.</p>
  <p> Empty your mind of all thoughts and distractions as if nothing else existed except that object or picture.</p>
  <p> Purposefully blank your mind of internal comments, evaluations or stray pictures.</p>
  <p> Do this for 60 seconds without interruption.</p>
  <p> If an interruptive thought occurs, or your conscious awareness fleets even for a moment to an extraneous sound or other sensory stimuli, start over again, but do this for one full minute.</p>
  <p> To illustrate, look at the black dot in the middle of the circle for 1 full minute without distraction.</p>
  <p> As simple as this exercise sounds, you'll be surprised how casual thoughts or interruptions will try to creep into your mind.</p>
  <p> Concentration in this way does not mean grimacing with a frown on your face.</p>
  <p> It simply involves a relaxed focalization on one subject only.</p>
  <p> Once you accomplish this externally, do the same exercise internally with your eyes closed.</p>
  <p> Look at the subject matter first, then close your eyes and see it in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> This technique rotates the mind's resonance from negative to neutral to positive, where a feeling of relief is felt.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, care must be taken not to have the same negative thought sequences shift you back again.</p>
  <p> Even getting close to doing this exercise correctly will bring about good results, so practice it a lot.</p>
  <p> It is the precursor to “<a href="EM/E020.html">Exercise 20 - Meditation</a>” discussed later.</p>
