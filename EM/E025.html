  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 25 </p><h1>Better Breathing, Better Emotions</h1>
  <p> There is a difference between breathing for bare survival and breathing for optimal usage of every breath.</p>
  <p> Lungs hold about 6 pints of air, but desk workers usually inhale only about a pint.</p>
  <p> Therefore five sixths of your lung capacity lies idle.</p>
  <p> Learning how to breathe properly gives you more energy, allows you to sleep better, wake up faster and suffer from less fatigue.</p>
  <p> Once you train yourself to breathe the right way, it becomes automatic.</p>
  <p> If you smoke, you even begin smoking less or not at all.</p>
  <p> Retention of your breath develops control, and slow exhalations relax body tissues to prevent your energy from becoming a form of tension.</p>
  <p> Your body sometimes automatically relieves tension by releasing the breath in the form of a sigh or a groan.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, begin by breathing in to the count of 4 and out to the count of 12.</p>
  <p> Do this sequence 10 times a day, over a 2 week span of time, and gradually increase the count until you are able to breathe in to the count of 7 seconds and out for the count of 21 seconds.</p>
  <p> Always do each sequence 10 times.</p>
  <p> Next, inhale slowly to the count of 4, hold it for the count of 16 and exhale slowly to the count of 8.</p>
  <p> When counting in this exercise, you might repeat, "Peace, Peace, Peace" or "Calm, Calm, Calm," for added relaxation.</p>
  <p> You can also mentally repeat the mantra, "AUM" over and over while you breathe.</p>
  <p> Next, increase the count ratio to 8:32:16, and then to 16:64:32.</p>
  <p> Always master one sequence comfortably before progressing to the next.</p>
  <p> By holding your breath, nervous feelings can often be reduced as you automatically tend to do in times of stress.</p>
  <p> By diaphragmatic, rhythmic breathing, regulation of the autonomic functions is more easily controlled.</p>
  <p> Emotional changes and shifts in moods are kept in check.</p>
  <p> Susceptibility to disease is lessened with a higher oxygen assimilation, and many startling, mental feats are easily achieved.</p>
  <p> Because of gravity, blood within the lungs favors the lower areas.</p>
  <p> Therefore when air is drawn into those areas, a more efficient mixing of blood and oxygen is achieved.</p>
  <p> Studies reveal that diaphragmatic muscles and the nerves governing their movement can produce relatively strong muscular electricity, the intensity of which varies with one's power of thought.</p>
  <p> Use of the body's bio-electricity is developed in some martial artists to such a high level that a powerful charge of energy can be delivered to an enemy from up to 10 feet away without touching him (see "<a href="HS/E107.html">Exercise 107 - Electromagnetic Field Awareness</a>")!</p>
