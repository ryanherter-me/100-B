  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 15 </p><h1>Consciously Disciplining Yourself</h1>
  <p> Consciously disciplining your life is always beneficial.</p>
  <p> Without discipline, you are ruled by your habits and your limbic brain emotions.</p>
  <p> Exhibiting no control over such emotions places you on the same level as the beasts of the world.</p>
  <p> The phrase, "I'm only human," is usually used to excuse irrational behavior.</p>
  <p> Are you less than 'human' when you consciously exhibit control over your primitive urges?</p>
  <p> Hardly.</p>
  <p> Then practice using your will power, and show yourself you have discipline.</p>
  <p> It has been found that electrical stimulation of parts of the limbic system in the brain produces a wide range of basic emotional responses like fear, lust, anger and pleasure.</p>
  <p> Brain experiments in the 60's with monkeys and human mental patients uncovered this fact very well.</p>
  <p> Fear, lust, anger and pleasure are the same emotions we share in common with all animals that have a limbic system.</p>
  <p> When fear sweeps through a crowd in a burning building, it can turn into blind panic with all those that are present.</p>
  <p> When anger sweeps over a lynch mob, everyone can get caught up with the mood and quickly turn ugly.</p>
  <p> On a teenage, rock and roll dance floor, teenagers easily get caught up with the pleasure of dancing to a famous rock starâ€™s music.</p>
  <p> Walking into a room filled with 50 fornicating and willing people can quickly sweep a person into similar behavior.</p>
  <p> Why are these examples true?</p>
  <p> When someone expresses anger towards you, you can get angry back at that person OR you can choose to get conscious and not respond with anger.</p>
  <p> If you consciously examine the emotions of the limbic system (anger, sex, fear, and pleasure) as they occur in you, instead of experiencing them automatically like a knee jerk, their dominance over you is minimized.</p>
  <p> By directing your conscious awareness into the subconsciously directed urge, the lower regions of the brain no longer dictate to you what you need.</p>
  <p> Who normally thinks about fear, sex, anger or pleasure?</p>
  <p> They simply occur and direct your life like a gut impulse without the tedium of conscious, directed thought, right?</p>
  <p> The limbic system requires 1/5 the energy that the higher frontal brain centers require to operate, so without practice using the cerebral cortex, it is just easier for people to use the limbic system.</p>
  <p> As an exercise (as long as there is no medical problem), do without eating for 24 hours.</p>
  <p> Simple enough, isn't it?</p>
  <p> Actually fasting for one day of the week is still practiced by many religious groups.</p>
  <p> It helps to purify the body.</p>
  <p> On the practical side, its costs nothing and there are no dishes to wash.</p>
  <p> Also, do without something else for 24 hours or longer that normally gives you pleasure.</p>
  <p> If necessary, visualize that you already had it, and the need for it should dissipate.</p>
  <p> While in your home with family or friends, don't talk for one hour, unless you're responding to a specific question.</p>
  <p> Do it for longer periods or at a party.</p>
  <p> After being silent for a while, you'll find that you appreciate and understand the importance of words in a more meaningful way.</p>
  <p> You'll also be amazed at how much more information you'll pick up this way.</p>
  <p> It's good discipline and it's good listening power too.</p>
  <p> The next time you meet someone, find out as much as possible about the person without talking about yourself.</p>
  <p> If he asks about your life, turn the questions tactfully around to him again.</p>
  <p> Do this without him suspecting what you're doing.</p>
  <p> As a drill in discipline, do something you normally don't like to do, but you know that you should do.</p>
  <p> If you are prone to putting certain things off, do them right away instead.</p>
  <p> If you say you're going to do something, DO IT.</p>
  <p> Don't confuse yourself with false promises.</p>
  <p> For positive reinforcement, remind yourself of your previous successes in exerting discipline over your emotional mind.</p>
  <p> Next, write a letter to a friend or relative without using the words: ME, I, MY or MINE.</p>
  <p> Stay up and work at some project all through the night, or create some other way to exert discipline for yourself.</p>
  <p> Discipline takes practice, so don't neglect yourself.</p>
  <p> Improve yourself.</p>
  <p> Think what it would be like to be without eyes, a tongue or your legs.</p>
  <p> Leg amputees have learned to climb mountains and play basketball.</p>
  <p> The dumb and blind have also overcome their handicaps through mental discipline in order to survive and cope in the world.</p>
  <p> Can you do less?</p>
  <p> After practicing discipline for a while, an attitude change occurs that allows your thinking to be modified.</p>
  <p> You begin structuring your life into NOT being led by your gut impulses.</p>
  <p> Doing what you want to do becomes a cognitive process, not a primal urge.</p>
  <p> Becoming conscious becomes enjoyable and you begin experiencing life on a higher rather than a lower level.</p>
  <p> You do things because you know they are good for your physical and mental health.</p>
  <p> You begin consciously choosing your thoughts, emotions and actions rather than allowing them to just happen randomly.</p>
  <p> It is not a forced process, but a natural one.</p>
