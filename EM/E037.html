  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 37 </p><h1>Swaying A Group Your Way</h1>
  <p> Mob psychology or gang thinking simply refers to the suggestibility at work in a group.</p>
  <p> One person coughs in a concert audience and soon others chime in.</p>
  <p> Lynch mobs or groups that panic when someone yells fire are other examples.</p>
  <p> Itâ€™s like a simple entrainment of mentalities on a basic, unconscious level.</p>
  <p> To influence a group on a conscious level and sway them in your direction, consciously create the thought that all the people that hear you will be receptive to you and your ideas.</p>
  <p> Continue mindfully to recharge that idea when addressing a group.</p>
  <p> With this thought-form in mind, you have consciously created intention and you have moved in a committed way towards achieving a desired result.</p>
  <p> To achieve whatever positive goal you want with a group of people, do the following exercise:</p>
  <p> 1) Find a mutual area of agreement with everyone.</p>
  <p> 2) Cease any bickering by having the people confirm what they agree upon.</p>
  <p> 3) Start the people discussing the benefits they are seeking.</p>
  <p> 4) Every time there is progress toward your goal, have it confirmed by the group.</p>
  <p> 5) Offer several variations of your idea so that the group can discuss which variation to use, rather than whether or not to choose your idea at all.</p>
  <p> 6) Finalize the decision with action and get the show on the road.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise when you want to influence an audience, a group or a crowd.</p>
  <p> Remember, if you act out your role as a convincing actor, people will believe you and eventually the role will feel comfortable for you to sustain as an altered behavioral pattern.</p>
  <p> Understand that every thought you have has an effect in some way.</p>
  <p> The clearer your intention and the more committed your action toward your intended goal, the easier and the faster you will achieve your goal.</p>
  <p> You can choose to move through life in an unconscious, unmindful way or you can choose to move through life in a conscious, mindful way.</p>
