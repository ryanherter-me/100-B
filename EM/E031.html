  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 31 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Abdominal Warming)</h1>
  <p> Through practice with auto-genic training, you will get better and better at consciously directing the physiological functions of your bodily cells when it becomes necessary.</p>
  <p> Accompanying this process, you also will achieve the side benefit of better emotional control as well.</p>
  <p> Studies have shown that repeated exposure to upsetting people, places or things actually lose their emotional impact, after continued practice with auto-genic training.</p>
  <p> There is more acceptance and less objection to the way people are in the world.</p>
  <p> Some psychiatric patients relax so deeply that they can ask their subconscious such questions as “What do I really need to be happy?” and receive the answer in a dream-like visualization.</p>
  <p> Other people find that they can induce a deep meditative state more easily after mastering these auto-genic exercises.</p>
  <p> Begin this exercise with the "warm-up" of "<a href="EM/E027.html">Exercise 27 - Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</a>."</p>
  <p> Then repeat the brief form of the heavy to warm formula, the heart and breathing formulas.</p>
  <p> If you prefer, you can rest your hand on your abdomen during the exercise.</p>
  <p> Now repeat to yourself, "My abdomen is radiating warmth," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "I feel completely calm," one time.</p>
  <p> If you find it easier, visualize the sun warming your abdomen.</p>
  <p> Do this exercise for 10 minutes at a time, 2 or 3 times per day for 2 weeks.</p>
  <p> If you feel a definite warmth before that time, then move on to the next exercise, but continue to practice and be thorough.</p>
