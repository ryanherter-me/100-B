  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 48 </p><h1>Changing Emotions Via Odors</h1>
  <p> The limbic system governs the primal urges of sex, hunger, anger, pleasure and fear; and olfactory impulses have direct pathways to this same center of the brain.</p>
  <p> Consequently, odors and primitive emotions have a closer association because of this link-up in the limbic system.</p>
  <p> In one experiment, human subjects were asked to complete a frustrating task as they were exposed to an unfamiliar odor.</p>
  <p> Later the same negative emotions associated with frustration occurred when exposed to that same odor.</p>
  <p> Scent manufacturers make millions of dollars each year by capitalizing on this connection in their attempt to emotionally get you to buy a particular product with a favorable odor - from soaps to perfumes.</p>
  <p> For this exercise, purchase a bottle of already blended natural essence from your local natural food store that has an unusual or unfamiliar odor - perhaps ambergris, civet, oak moss or myrrh.</p>
  <p> Now take it to a party or friend's house where you're likely to experience joy, laughter or some other pleasurable experience.</p>
  <p> At the optimal height of one of these good feelings, put a few drops of the essence on your arm and smell it frequently.</p>
  <p> In the future, to get out of a 'down' or negative mood, whip out your essence and begin smelling it again!</p>
  <p> You should become elated very quickly.</p>
  <p> Laugh and smile to yourself when this happens, for it enhances the effect.</p>
