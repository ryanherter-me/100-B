  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 39 </p><h1>Boost A Person’s Sense Of Importance</h1>
  <p> With many people, there is a distinct need to feel important.</p>
  <p> Without this feeling fulfilled, a person often suffers from self-doubt, guilt, insecurity and low self-worth.</p>
  <p> Those same people will go to great lengths to maintain a good reputation, or to demonstrate that they are needed, or to gain a bit of self-esteem, or to prove their superiority, or to show that they're right, or even to meet a challenge presented to them.</p>
  <p> If you diplomatically satisfy these areas to such ego-oriented people, you become master over any situation with them.</p>
  <p> Their emotional mind loves it, and their logical mind is suspended.</p>
  <p> As a daily exercise, exhibit a little thought when you handle your next people situation, and see how well it works.</p>
  <p> For example: To a boss that normally reprimands you: "If it wasn't for your astute judgment, the efficiency of the company certainly wouldn't be as high.</p>
  <p> It sure is fortunate that you keep everyone on their toes."</p>
  <p> To a lover or spouse going through a bout of negativity: "You're the best example I know of someone doing the best he can in any situation.</p>
  <p> Therefore I know that whatever decision you make, it'll be a good one."</p>
  <p> As a further exercise, work with a friend and alternate with each other on skillful, ego-boosting remarks based on the principles outlined above.</p>
  <p> In actual situations, they will work wonderfully, and they will seem a lot less artificial.</p>
  <p> You'll be delighted and surprised.</p>
