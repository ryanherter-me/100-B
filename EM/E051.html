  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 51 </p><h1>Journal Writing For Emotional Calming</h1>
  <p> Writing in a journal has many advantages.</p>
  <p> It can clarify your goals and sharpen your thoughts each day about what is important to you and what you really want out of life.</p>
  <p> Your self-worth is enhanced as you note your daily achievements and joys of life.</p>
  <p> Problems also seem minimized when they are written down on paper.</p>
  <p> You will learn to express your feelings better, and when you learn to express your feelings, you strengthen your relationships.</p>
  <p> Journaling can also be a form of meditation.</p>
  <p> It can quiet your mind and focus your thoughts.</p>
  <p> It can reduce your anxiety, cheer you up and make you smile.</p>
  <p> Did you ever write a letter in anger to someone, but wind up not sending it?</p>
  <p> Whether you did or didn't send it, it still gave you a form of relief in writing out on paper your feelings, didn't it?</p>
  <p> Studies have revealed that people that write in personal diaries or journals recover faster from personal tragedies and stressful events.</p>
  <p> It makes you feel good to put your innermost thoughts on paper.</p>
  <p> In doing so, it has a cathartic effect on your psyche because you've expressed yourself outwardly and no longer have your feelings bottled up.</p>
  <p> When your thoughts are viewed on paper, they seem more manageable.</p>
  <p> Many people have emotional difficulties in life because they simply have not bothered getting in touch with their emotions.</p>
  <p> It's like the old saying, "Before all else, to thine own self be true; know thyself."</p>
  <p> In fact, repressing your feelings is one of the leading causes of mental illness.</p>
  <p> Many times, friends, taxi drivers and psychiatrists serve the purpose of acting as a sounding board, and thereby allowing you to get in touch with the feelings that are troubling you.</p>
  <p> Keeping a journal will help you know yourself better and thereafter express yourself more clearly.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, experiment for yourself with journal writing.</p>
  <p> If you have a perplexing life situation, express yourself and write your feelings out on paper or in a journal.</p>
  <p> Describe the emotions you can identify.</p>
  <p> Oftentimes, greater clarity can be yours as to what to do next when you write about your emotional troubles in a journal.</p>
  <p> Another exercise in emotional coping can be writing down an overview of your life story or a brief autobiography of yourself.</p>
  <p> You might begin by writing about whatever memorable words and phrases you can remember from your childhood.</p>
  <p> Without realizing it, many of these early shoulds and should nots & dos and don'ts may be inhibiting your freedom, censoring your awareness and restricting your energy.</p>
  <p> Honestly evaluate what you've written and determine for yourself whether it's still useful or valid for your life.</p>
  <p> Write down meaningful changes and events all the way to the present time.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, reading what you have written to yourself or even sharing it with someone else that has done likewise can provide you with powerful insight toward improvement.</p>
  <p> When two or more people do this in an honest and reciprocal way, a broader picture is often afforded to all concerned.</p>
  <p> Self-acceptance, self-worth and self-confidence is more easily embraced.</p>
  <p> A further exercise in journal writing is to keep yourself focused on your goals in life.</p>
  <p> This often entails an awareness of your daily states of mind that may be blocking you each day.</p>
  <p> By writing down on a daily basis your progress toward specific goals, you can keep yourself on target and see where stuck conditions or reactive emotions are keeping you from achieving your goals.</p>
  <p> You could write Headings in your journal with daily progress notes alongside them and possible conflicts you encounter.</p>
  <p> Any journal format will do, even a 3-ring binder or a computer page.</p>
