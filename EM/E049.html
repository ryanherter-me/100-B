  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 49 </p><h1>Control The Meaning Of Words</h1>
  <p> As long as words carry meaning, the mind is occupied with the thought of that meaning.</p>
  <p> When the words become meaningless, there is nothing left in the consciousness except the monotonous sound-image, and that too then can disappear.</p>
  <p> Your name always catches your attention if mentioned in a crowd.</p>
  <p> Much of your identity is often bound up in your name.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, say your name the way you normally answer to it and repeat it aloud for a full 5 minutes.</p>
  <p> If your name is John Schofield and you are called Johnny, then repeat aloud Johnny Schofield softly to yourself.</p>
  <p> After a few moments, your first and last names will begin to run together in a blur of sound.</p>
  <p> Don't stop though; continue repeating your name aloud for 5 minutes.</p>
  <p> You may become disoriented after hearing your name reduced to a continual sound.</p>
  <p> Old remembrances of you as a child or infant will pop up.</p>
  <p> You also might find yourself externalizing and viewing yourself repeat your name as if you were outside the body.</p>
  <p> The exercise is directed toward an intuitive knowing that you are more than a name and identity, more than your body and physical brain, more than your job or daily role playing, more than your individual sex and even more than your mind.</p>
  <p> The poet, Tennyson, could spontaneously evoke mystical experiences with himself by the technique of repeating aloud his name over and over again.</p>
