  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 45 </p><h1>Physical Tension Release</h1>
  <p> Aside from identifying your various emotional states, can you identify your physical states?</p>
  <p> Naturally, you know when you are tired or when you are excited, but can you discern the level of your energy when the difference is not so extreme?</p>
  <p> You usually also know when you are sick, but can you discern the subtler changes in your physical health?</p>
  <p> Can you recognize any tension in the various parts of your body?</p>
  <p> As an exercise, begin identifying your current physical state to a partner.</p>
  <p> Then let your partner do the same with you.</p>
  <p> Now consciously scan your whole body while sitting in your chair.</p>
  <p> Describe to your partner any areas of physical tension, strain or poor posture.</p>
  <p> When you discover an area, stay in the area with your conscious attention for a few minutes and describe any feelings that come to you while you are doing this.</p>
  <p> Now reverse the roles, and let your partner do the same thing.</p>
  <p> Since your personality can change with a change in physical posture, being more mindful of how you sit, stand and walk during the day might also bring about more positive changes in the way you act.</p>
  <p> Even the way you hold your facial muscles affects your personality.</p>
  <p> Those suffering from multiple personalities often have different prescription glasses with each personality, because their facial muscles are held differently in each personality!</p>
  <p> Even smiling and laughing more can make a big difference.</p>
  <p> As an exercise when tense, tired or headachy and while standing or sitting, bend your knees slightly and place your hands high on your thighs.</p>
  <p> Draw your neck in like a turtle with the chin forward and up.</p>
  <p> A slight contraction will be felt at the base of your neck.</p>
  <p> Now draw your shoulders upward as if to touch them to your ears.</p>
  <p> Push down with the hands to draw the shoulders higher.</p>
  <p> If done correctly, a vibration will be felt in the neck, shoulders and head.</p>
  <p> Avoid breathing during the exercise and hold this vibration for a comfortable period.</p>
  <p> Then release and relax your muscles, beginning with the fingertips and working upwards.</p>
  <p> The vibration will release built-up tension and you may resume a more normal energy level.</p>
  <p> Tension, stress and even depression can be overcome by the following exercise: Place the shoulder blades as nearly together as you can without strain, then breathe out gently and fully.</p>
  <p> Pause, then inhale with a deep, slow, gentle breath until the lungs are comfortably filled.</p>
  <p> Breathe out slowly through the nose with a long sigh and without altering the position of the shoulder blades.</p>
  <p> Do this a dozen times and your tension should disappear.</p>
  <p> Why?</p>
  <p> Because you have just supplied the brain with positive, stimulating oxygen.</p>
