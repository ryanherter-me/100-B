  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 24 </p><h1>Alternate Nostril Breathing For Mood Control</h1>
  <p> Sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight, and close your right nostril with your thumb.</p>
  <p> Inhale slowly through the left nostril to the count of 5.</p>
  <p> Exhale through the same nostril to the count of 10.</p>
  <p> Exhalation time is always twice the inhalation time.</p>
  <p> Do this 15 to 20 times through the left nostril.</p>
  <p> Now close the left nostril with your right ring finger and little finger and inhale through the right nostril.</p>
  <p> Inhale to the count of 5 and exhale to the count of 10.</p>
  <p> Repeat 15 to 20 times.</p>
  <p> Do not make a sound during inhalation and exhale the air as much as possible from your lungs.</p>
  <p> There is no retention of the air in this exercise.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise two times a day for 15 days, then increase the proportion time to 6 seconds for inhalation and 12 seconds for exhalation.</p>
  <p> Do this twice a day for another 30 days and you'll notice your low, mid and high breathing automatically improving.</p>
  <p> Your tension and stress in life will sharply lessen as well.</p>
  <p> You can vary this exercise by visualizing the incoming air having an energizing color of your own choosing.</p>
  <p> Put your conscious awareness into each breath, and see and feel the air as you draw it into your lungs.</p>
  <p> Breathing through different sides of the nose affects a person's behavior.</p>
  <p> We normally alternate nostrils every 1 to 4 hours.</p>
  <p> The older the breather, the longer the duration of the cycle.</p>
  <p> When you lie on your side, your lower nostril congests while the upper one opens.</p>
  <p> Also, if there is pressure on one armpit, the nostril on the other side will open.</p>
  <p> Research has revealed that certain stress-related diseases occur when the right nostril is blocked.</p>
  <p> When the nasal obstruction is corrected, stress is relieved.</p>
  <p> Left nostril blockages don't cause the same problems.</p>
  <p> There is also some evidence to indicate that breathing through one nostril stimulates activity in the opposite side of the brain.</p>
  <p> By determining which nostril you're using the most at any given time, you can tell which side of the brain you're activating the most.</p>
  <p> By forcing a switch in your nostril breathing, you can also shift into the hemisphere you want to utilize as well.</p>
  <p> Sometimes to alter an unwanted state of mind, you can just breathe through your congested nostril 15 to 20 times.</p>
