  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 27 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</h1>
  <p> In 1932, German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz first published Das Autogene Training (autogenic training) as a therapy later taught in European clinics.</p>
  <p> Autogenic training consists of a series of 6 exercises which are outlined in the following pages.</p>
  <p> To achieve optimal results with this suggestive conditioning exercise, wait at least an hour and a half after eating a meal, then assume a comfortable sitting or lying down position.</p>
  <p> Relax all your muscles from your toes to your head and take deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> Breathe slowly, and exhale for twice as long as you inhale.</p>
  <p> For example, inhale to the count of 3 and exhale to the count of 6.</p>
  <p> Do this series 3 times; then inhale to the count of 4 and exhale to the count of 8.</p>
  <p> Do this 3 times; then inhale to the count of 5 and exhale to the count of 10.</p>
  <p> Repeat 3 times; then go in reverse.</p>
  <p> Breathe in for 5 beats and out for 10 beats; then in 4 and out 8; then in 3 and out 6.</p>
  <p> Each time repeat the sequence 3 times.</p>
  <p> This is your "warm-up."</p>
  <p> Now silently repeat to yourself the following “limb heaviness” (relaxation) affirmations: Say, "My right arm is getting heavy," 6 to 8 times; then say, "My right arm is getting heavier and heavier," 6 to 8 times; then reiterate, "My right arm is completely heavy," 6 to 8 times; visualize its heaviness like lead; then say, "I feel perfectly calm," 3 times.</p>
  <p> Then open your eyes and throw away the heaviness.</p>
  <p> Flex your arm and breathe deeply.</p>
  <p> Now begin the cycle again, including the warm-up.</p>
  <p> Spend 10 to 15 minutes each time and do this 2 or 3 times per day.</p>
  <p> To intensify the effect, visualize yourself in a peaceful, background setting, and actually imagine your arm getting heavier.</p>
  <p> Don't try too hard; just relax and let it happen.</p>
  <p> Do the exercise with your right arm for 3 days.</p>
  <p> Then using the same formula, do the same exercise with your left arm for 3 days.</p>
  <p> Then do it with both arms together for 3 days.</p>
  <p> Then do the right leg for 3 days; then do your left leg for 3 days; then do both legs together for 3 days; and finally do both arms and legs together for 3 days.</p>
  <p> Thus, the heaviness exercise takes 21 days.</p>
  <p> If you achieve genuine heaviness sooner, move along faster, but be thorough.</p>
  <p> If you continue to practice, results will be yours.</p>
  <p> Belief has little to do with the process; practice alone is important.</p>
  <p> What you are achieving here is a consciously directed altered state of awareness, similar to self-hypnosis.</p>
  <p> With continued practice, you will get use to producing a physical response by simply suggesting it.</p>
  <p> After mastering this conditioning exercise, you will be able to bring about this adjusted state in yourself in less than a minute, and under any circumstances.</p>
