  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 23 </p><h1>Cleansing Breath For Better Health</h1>
  <p> Surprising to Westerners is the fact that good controlled breathing has a great deal to do with all the extranormal powers exhibited by yogis and lamas of the East.</p>
  <p> How could such a simple thing like breathing be connected to better mental powers?</p>
  <p> The Hindus call breathing exercises pranayama, which is the control of the prana or subtle "life" energy of your breath.</p>
  <p> Food and drink are important, but if your breath ceases, all other manifestations of energy and movement of your body stop automatically.</p>
  <p> When you control the motion of your lungs, you control the subtle prana.</p>
  <p> When your life energy is controlled, every part of your body can be filled with it and bodily control is much easier.</p>
  <p> All diseases of your body can be eliminated by controlling and regulating your life energy, and it brings about the power of healing.</p>
  <p> If your body is strong and healthy with an abundance of life energy, your radiating vibrations will benefit the people around you as well.</p>
  <p> In ordinary breathing, you extract very little energy, but when you consciously regulate your breathing, you are able to store up in your various nerve centers and brain a greater amount of this vitalizing energy.</p>
  <p> It makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> You're supercharging your cells with oxygen which is better than depleting them of it.</p>
  <p> Now sit up in a comfortable position with good posture and place your hand on your upper abdomen to feel the motion of your diaphragm.</p>
  <p> Now forcibly exhale, pushing your stomach in with a backward push so that your diaphragm recedes into your thoracic cavity, expelling the air from your lungs.</p>
  <p> Follow this instantly with a relaxation of your abdominal muscles, allowing the diaphragm to descend down to your abdominal cavity, pulling with it your lungs.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, exhalation takes about one fourth the time of inhalation.</p>
  <p> The exhalation process is quick and strong while inhalation is passive and slow.</p>
  <p> Do this for 15 to 20 times twice each day, and add a few more exhalations each week as your lungs become stronger.</p>
