  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 13 </p><h1>Fear Reversal Imaging</h1>
  <p> The dictionary definition of fear is a painful emotion marked by alarm, dread or anxiety.</p>
  <p> To evaluate a fear's necessity for survival, you can use test it with the 'fight or flight' response.</p>
  <p> Is there protection available?</p>
  <p> Can you protect yourself by fighting?</p>
  <p> Is escape available?</p>
  <p> Can you protect yourself by running away?</p>
  <p> If you can't justify the fear by fighting or running away, the fear is unnecessary to your survival.</p>
  <p> Coupled with the emotion of fear are physiological responses that prepare the body for fight or flight.</p>
  <p> Muscles tense, mouth gets dry, palms sweat with nervous perspiration, gastric secretions cease, adrenalin is shot into the system, the heart beats faster and the blood pressure rises.</p>
  <p> If there is no fight or flight energy released by the body, the physiological changes can cause damage to the bodily system.</p>
  <p> Mostly this is in an accumulative way, but fear has also caused sudden psychological blindness, deafness or speechlessness, hair to turn white or even death.</p>
  <p> Fears can be based on a negative expectation of something, sometimes accompanied by feelings of helplessness or some kind of lack.</p>
  <p> To help yourself, first identify what specifically you are fearful of.</p>
  <p> You might say you have a fear of flying, but in reality it is a fear of crashing.</p>
  <p> That is the negative expectation.</p>
  <p> How do you reverse it?</p>
  <p> You turn the negative expectation into a positive one.</p>
  <p> Do "<a href="/EM/E007.html">Exercise 7 - Relaxation For Improved Awareness</a>" prior to this exercise.</p>
  <p> To reverse a fear of crashing in an airplane, first visualize yourself driving from your home to the airport.</p>
  <p> You feel calm as you approach the airplane and take your seat inside.</p>
  <p> See yourself smiling throughout.</p>
  <p> Everyone around you is happy and thoughtful.</p>
  <p> Your stewardess gives you a magazine to read and afterwards brings you a meal.</p>
  <p> Your flight and landing is smooth and peasant.</p>
  <p> You smile as you leave the plane.</p>
  <p> You proceed to what the trip was about -- visiting friends, relatives or business associates.</p>
  <p> You enjoy and complete the visit; then return to the airport and board another plane.</p>
  <p> After a gentle take-off and smooth flight, you land again and proceed home.</p>
  <p> If you perform this visualization exercise at least 3 times a day for one or two weeks prior to your flight, your fear should be greatly alleviated and flying will become expectantly enjoyed.</p>
  <p> The same process can be employed with any fear.</p>
  <p> First determine what the negative expectation is, then create a visualization to reverse it into a positive expectation.</p>
  <p> Everything in your life can be controlled by your thoughts.</p>
  <p> Remember, you can do anything if you think you can.</p>
  <p> Since you create your own fears, you can eliminate them too.</p>
  <p> Worry is the inward dwelling on something you don't want to happen and should be avoided.</p>
  <p> When fear is associated with a feeling of helplessness in operating successfully in the world, visualizations can help alleviate this state of mind.</p>
  <p> Visualizations are very powerful to your body/mind combination, and chemical changes happen in your body as a result of them.</p>
  <p> If you visualize sucking on a lemon, you can bring about the physiological change of increased salivation.</p>
  <p> If you visualize being buried alive, the psychological change of terror can be brought about.</p>
  <p> If you acknowledge these principles, it naturally follows that correct visualizations can bring about beneficial physiological and psychological changes, right?!</p>
