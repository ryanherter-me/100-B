  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 30 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Rhythmic Respiration)</h1>
  <p> Mastering these autogenic training exercises gives the participant the same control over your body as the yogis and lamas of the East.</p>
  <p> People with ulcers, gastrointestinal disorders, even heart problems and abnormal brain waves, improve these conditions by mentally taking charge of their bodies in a relaxed way.</p>
  <p> Do the "warm-up" of "<a href="EM/E027.html">Exercise 27 - Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</a>" again.</p>
  <p> Then say, "My arms and legs are getting limp, heavy and warm," 1 to 2 times.</p>
  <p> Then repeat, "My arms and legs are getting heavier and warmer," 1 to 2 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "My arms and legs are completely heavy and warm," 1 to 2 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "My heartbeat is calm and steady," 1 to 2 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "I feel completely calm," one time.</p>
  <p> Now repeat, "My breathing is supremely calm," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "I feel completely calm," one time.</p>
  <p> Do this exercise for 10 minutes 2 or 3 times per day for 2 weeks.</p>
  <p> It is considered mastered when you can breathe calm and rhythmically without difficulty, after light activity or nervous stimulation.</p>
