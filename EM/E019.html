  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 19 </p><h1>Concentration On Emptiness</h1>
  <p> Sit in a comfortable position and relax with your eyes closed for a few moments.</p>
  <p> Now just observe your thoughts creeping into your consciousness, each one clamoring for attention -- daily events, emotional problems, future desires, etc.</p>
  <p> Now imagine you are in a completely dark room with a large picture window covered by a black blind.</p>
  <p> There is no pattern to the blind.</p>
  <p> It is just black.</p>
  <p> Concentrate now on that blind without allowing any distracting thoughts to intrude.</p>
  <p> If they do, push them back out of the way.</p>
  <p> Simply continue to concentrate on the black blind.</p>
  <p> When you can hold an expression of complete blankness for just a short time, you will begin to have a different perspective, where time and distance take on a new meaning.</p>
  <p> Continued practice gives you better and better control over the sundry idle thoughts constantly trying to invade your consciousness.</p>
  <p> When you can control your thoughts during your daily life, you're one giant step further on your ladder of progressive development.</p>
  <p> If it helps, imagine that you are a yogi or a lama that already has this power heightened to a fine tuned degree.</p>
