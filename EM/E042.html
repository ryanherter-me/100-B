  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 42 </p><h1>Handling Criticism From People</h1>
  <p> Criticism from other people is negativity - constructive or otherwise, and it’s a negativity that can be very short lived if handled properly.</p>
  <p> What really matters is how the person receiving the criticism experiences it, not what the criticizer's intention is.</p>
  <p> A face to face emotional confrontation designed to rip you up one side and down the other can be handled simply by - silence, a blank stare and no responsive gestures.</p>
  <p> The more your opponent tries to get you angered, the more frustrated he becomes, and soon he just shuts up.</p>
  <p> If he queries why you are not responding, just say, "Would you?" and revert back to the silent treatment.</p>
  <p> You'll have no more trouble from there.</p>
  <p> There is an energy emitted through your eyes (see "<a href="EM/E047.html">Exercise 47 - Eye Contact For Inner Communication</a>").</p>
  <p> An impassive, non-responsive stare jams or deflects the bombardment of the negative energy that the other person directs toward you.</p>
  <p> Refusing to swirl yourself into 'synch' with a negative energy display leaves the other person frustrated, bewildered and exhausted.</p>
  <p> To handle the behind-your-back criticizer, go to that person (without mentioning his criticism of you), and praise that person for the very thing that he is criticizing you about.</p>
  <p> Many times a person criticizes you for the very thing they dislike in themselves, like a mirror effect.</p>
  <p> By praising them on it, their insecurity is temporarily relieved and they no longer need to look at you so harshly.</p>
  <p> If they criticize you on the way you dress, praise them on the way they dress.</p>
  <p> If they criticize you on the way you talk, praise them on the way they talk, etc.</p>
  <p> Always remember that patient encouragement, guidance and support are far more helpful than delivering criticism to people.</p>
  <p> Don’t tell another person what to do, but let them tell you!</p>
  <p> Support a person where they are, and in whatever they decide to do.</p>
  <p> This is critical.</p>
  <p> Most individuals with suppressed emotions have them because of an experience, accident or other trauma and it wasn’t OK to express them at the time.</p>
  <p> They need the trust and security that they are in charge and that they are not being pushed into anything that they do not wish to do.</p>
  <p> They can stop when they have had enough, and they usually know when that time is.</p>
  <p> You can be with them at that time and tell them that it is all right.</p>
  <p> This is an exercise in assisting another person with emotional healing that you can practice whenever the need arises.</p>
