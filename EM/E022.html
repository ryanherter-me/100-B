  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 22 </p><h1>Connected Breathing For Increased Energy</h1>
  <p> The purpose of conscious, connected breathing is not for the movement of air, but rather for the movement of energy.</p>
  <p> By doing relaxed, connected breathing for a few minutes, you begin to experience dynamic energy flowing throughout your body.</p>
  <p> The more that you practice it, the more relaxed and peaceful you feel.</p>
  <p> In Eastern philosophies, this flowing of energy via conscious, connected breathing is the merging of spirit and matter.</p>
  <p> It creates harmony between your body, mind and soul.</p>
  <p> Breathing is such a simple thing, but conscious breathing involves activating the upper cortical brain cells.</p>
  <p> If you inhale and hold your breath to lift a weight, you maintain control until the breath is released.</p>
  <p> Normally you involuntarily breathe 14 to 18 times a minute.</p>
  <p> The more excitable you are, the more breaths per minute you take.</p>
  <p> When you're reading a book, you breathe differently than when you're making love.</p>
  <p> Different physical activities and mental states require different modes of breathing.</p>
  <p> For instance, fear, worry and depression often interfere with proper breathing.</p>
  <p> Gradual oxygen deprivation can in turn cause mental and physical impairment.</p>
  <p> The amount of air you inspire is known as your vital capacity and can be measured by a watch-size instrument called a spirometer.</p>
  <p> To test your expiration capacity, take a deep breath, open your mouth wide (no pursed lips) and see if you can blow out a match held 3 inches from your lips.</p>
  <p> If you can't, you need help.</p>
  <p> To illustrate how you can voluntarily control your breathing, take a deep, abdominal breath, and read the following paragraph aloud without inhaling.</p>
  <p> Powerful effects can be felt by controlling your inhalation and exhalation in a connected way.</p>
  <p> By gently, but deeply breathing in and out without a pause in between, you can supercharge your system with energizing oxygen.</p>
  <p> Maintain this connected breathing in a relaxed rhythm (don't force yourself into a hyperventilating syndrome) for an hour a day for 30 consecutive days, and you will feel far more able to successfully accomplish many of the other exercises in this manual.</p>
  <p> Your stress and negative emotions will dissipate too.</p>
  <p> There is a merging of your pure life energy with the air you breathe that will send vibrations throughout your body in a cleansing, nourishing way.</p>
  <p> By controlling your breathing in this way, you can physically extend your life.</p>
  <p> Connected breathing is a relaxing and natural process that can leave you with a euphoric feeling.</p>
  <p> It is a very cleansing process that can also clear out physical, mental and emotional blocks.</p>
  <p> About 3% of the bodyâ€™s wastes are eliminated by defecation and 7% by urination.</p>
  <p> The skin excretes another 20%, leaving the remain- ing 70% to be breathed out.</p>
  <p> Maintaining connected deep breathing for about an hour can also slip you into an altered state of consciousness where old images and feelings come to mind.</p>
  <p> These patterns can be consciously observed, and allowed to pass on without their having any psychological effect on you!</p>
  <p> As an adjunct to the above exercise, take in a deep, abdominal breath and hold it.</p>
  <p> Now stick your tongue out and bring the air up as if to exhale, but instead put a throat lock on it and gag.</p>
  <p> The gagging noise is not necessary, but directing the air and 'life energy' to your brain and eyes is important.</p>
  <p> Some people experience a similar action while having a bowel movement."</p>
  <p> It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matt. 4:4)</p>
  <p> If your essence is part of God's universal essence, could not your affirmations and visualizations be directed to help produce the necessary sustenance for survival?</p>
  <p> Breatharians are people that utilize breath and combine it with light to manufacture food for their bodies.</p>
  <p> This 'animal photosynthetic' process is little understood, for breatharians cut down their ingested food intake to little or nothing at all.</p>
  <p> When Jack Schwarz was studied by the Menninger Foundation, he ate one bowl of rice per week and defecated 3 full bowel movements per day.</p>
  <p> Since his body weight remained the same, where did the extra dross material come from?</p>
  <p> Perhaps everyone is a breatharian in some way, because each person metabolizes the same amount of food differently.</p>
  <p> Does the process go beyond metabolism?</p>
  <p> Do you actually assimilate the elements of light, air and some universal energy to create auxiliary amounts of food?</p>
  <p> Have you ever had the feeling of "being full" and not wanting to eat after a sun bath?</p>
  <p> When fasting, visualize having eaten a sumptuous meal and notice the satiated effect.</p>
  <p> Hunger is more often a subconscious habit than it is a necessity.</p>
  <p> The overweight population of the world attests to this observation.</p>
  <p> Maintaining conscious control over your life negates this tendency to overeat.</p>
  <p> In fact, through the power of visualization and your inner 'knowingness,' you can really eat what you want and still lose weight.</p>
  <p> By such inner control, the elements of your ingested food can be either assimilated or passed.</p>
  <p> Your metabolic rate can be either stepped up or slowed, and you learn that you are in complete charge of your bodily functions.</p>
