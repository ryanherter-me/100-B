  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 32 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Cooling The Forehead)</h1>
  <p> This is the last in this series of 6 auto-genic training exercises.</p>
  <p> Each of the exercises must be learned before proceeding to the next in sequence.</p>
  <p> Unlike yoga, auto-genic training does not involve difficult postures or breath control exercises.</p>
  <p> There is no equipment and there is little time actually devoted to practice (5 to 10 minutes 3 times per day).</p>
  <p> Yet learning this ingenious combination of suggestion and conditioning will enable you to bring about deep therapeutic relaxation under stress automatically.</p>
  <p> With just a thought, you can relax any part of your body at any given moment during your day.</p>
  <p> To begin this exercise, start with the "warm-up" of "<a href="EM/E027.html">Exercise 27 - Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</a>."</p>
  <p> Now repeat the short form of the heavy to warm formula and then the heart, breathing and abdominal formulas.</p>
  <p> Now say, "My forehead is cool," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then repeat to yourself, "I feel completely calm," one time.</p>
  <p> With this exercise, imagine a cool breeze blowing across your forehead.</p>
  <p> To get the right feeling, actually stand in front of a fan to see how it feels at first.</p>
  <p> Then afterwards visualize the same feeling in your mind, but don't focus your conscious awareness on your forehead or you will bring about a warm blood flow into the area.</p>
  <p> Repeat this suggestive conditioning for 10 minutes at a time, 3 times a day for 2 weeks.</p>
  <p> When you experience a definite coolness on the forehead, you've mastered it.</p>
  <p> Upon terminating a session, open your eyes and begin to move gradually by flexing and stretching your muscles to throw off the heavy feeling.</p>
  <p> To maintain facility in doing these auto-genic training exercises, practice at least once each day using these techniques in your daily life.</p>
  <p> Invent your own techniques revolving around the same suggestive principles.</p>
  <p> Remember, practice is the key, and you can get good at anything through practice.</p>
