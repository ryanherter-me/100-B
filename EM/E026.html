  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 26 </p><h1>Rhythmic Breathing To Harmonize Body/Mind Processes</h1>
  <p> Rhythmic breath control slows down body and mind rhythms and helps to resynchronize out-of-synch body/mind processes.</p>
  <p> To begin this exercise, relax in a chair or lie down on a couch or bed and close your eyes.</p>
  <p> Take in a slow, deep breath of as much air as you can hold.</p>
  <p> Now exhale slowly, but completely.</p>
  <p> Inhale 10 deep abdominal breaths and each time exhale slowly by pulling your abdomen in.</p>
  <p> Now make your breathing rhythmic.</p>
  <p> Inhale to the count of 4; hold it to the count of 4; exhale to the count of 4; and pause to the count of 4.</p>
  <p> Repeat 3 cadences of this rhythmic pattern.</p>
  <p> Now relax.</p>
  <p> Next, inhale to the count of 6; hold it to the count of 6; exhale to the count of 6; and pause to the count of 6.</p>
  <p> Repeat this process 3 times.</p>
  <p> Now do the same thing to a count of 8.</p>
  <p> Repeat that 3 times.</p>
  <p> Do this series daily.</p>
  <p> Another variation of this exercise is to do as above, but synchronize the counts of your breaths to the beats of your pulse.</p>
  <p> Remember all breathing exercises should be done gently and never forced, so practice them frequently and during the idle moments throughout your day.</p>
