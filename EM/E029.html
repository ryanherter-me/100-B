  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 29 </p><h1>Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Calming The Heartbeat)</h1>
  <p> To make voluntary that which is normally involuntary is bringing conscious control over areas of your body that are normally reflexive or automatically governed by "subconscious" signals.</p>
  <p> If you can consciously exercise control over your breathing, you can do the same with your heartbeat.</p>
  <p> Belief has little to do with the process; practice alone is important!</p>
  <p> Laboratory investigations have shown that muscle response, blood flow, skin temperature, brain waves, metabolism and blood chemistry shift in the direction of a relaxed state during practice, and abnormal conditions move slowly toward normalcy with continued practice.</p>
  <p> Actually, many emotional problems are also relieved with autogenic training, and these techniques are widely used in Europe to help people along these lines!</p>
  <p> You can get good at anything with continued practice, so why not get good at consciously mastering control over your autonomic bodily functions?</p>
  <p> In the beginning, do this exercise lying down.</p>
  <p> Do the "warm-up" of "<a href="EM/E027.html">Exercise 27 - Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</a>" and then repeat the heavy to warm formula 3 times.</p>
  <p> Now mentally bring your conscious awareness to your heartbeat.</p>
  <p> Become aware of it in your chest or in the pulse of your wrist or wherever.</p>
  <p> At first, resting your hand on your chest might help.</p>
  <p> Now visualize an anxiety situation for yourself like; confronting a mugger, being buried alive or whatever.</p>
  <p> Can you feel its increased rate of speed?</p>
  <p> Now repeat silently, "My chest feels warm and pleasant," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Then say, "My heartbeat is calm and steady," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Visualize and feel your heart beating slower in response to your inner "thought beat."</p>
  <p> Visualize your heart beating slower.</p>
  <p> Then repeat, "I feel completely calm," 6 to 8 times.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise for 10 minutes twice per day for 2 weeks.</p>
