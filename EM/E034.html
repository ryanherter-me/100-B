  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 34 </p><h1>Polarize Your Energy With Breathing</h1>
  <p> By methodically and rhythmically breathing in oxygen, the mind and body are charged with energy.</p>
  <p> By visualizing a positive energy flow as you inhale and a negative energy flow as you exhale, worries and anxieties can be dissipated from your mind.</p>
  <p> When performing this polarization exercise correctly, a tingling sensation is often felt with each breath.</p>
  <p> To begin this exercise, lie down on a couch or bed with your feet pointing south and your head north to align yourself with the earth's magnetic field.</p>
  <p> Assume a comfortable, relaxed position with your hands touching the sides of your body, palms up.</p>
  <p> Begin breathing through your nose with slow, deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> As you inhale, visualize warm, bright yellow sun energy drawing through the top of your head, surging through your body and exiting through the soles of your feet.</p>
  <p> Imagine this yellow sun energy as a positive current.</p>
  <p> Now slowly exhale and visualize cool, blue moon energy being drawn up through the bottom of your feet, pulsing through your body, and exiting through the top of your head.</p>
  <p> Imagine this blue moon energy as a negative current.</p>
  <p> Synchronize this visualization of the inhaling yellow and exhaling blue with the breathing process, and experience a sensing of vibration internally.</p>
  <p> This will not only improve your concentration abilities, but it will also charge up your body in preparation for any new tasks of the day.</p>
