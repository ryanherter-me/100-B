  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 5 </p><h1>Eliminating Your Negative </h1>
  <p> Since many unconscious anchors that engender negative responses are sometimes elusive to recognize, this exercise will help collapse these unwanted states.</p>
  <p> To begin this exercise, trigger your anchor for confidence, and get yourself into the most powerful and positive state that you can muster.</p>
  <p> Then open your hand and put that feeling into your right hand.</p>
  <p> Now think of a time when you were enthusiastic and exhilarated over something, and put that feeling into your right hand too.</p>
  <p> Now recall a time when you were feeling love, happiness and joy, and put that into your right hand.</p>
  <p> Now notice how it feels to have all those feelings in your right hand.</p>
  <p> What color do you think they would make all together like that?</p>
  <p> What shape or form would they take in your hand?</p>
  <p> What sound would they make, if you gave them a sound?</p>
  <p> What texture do they feel like in your hand?</p>
  <p> What positive words does this combination say to you from your hand?</p>
  <p> Now open your left hand, and place in it some negative experience or something that has been bothering you.</p>
  <p> It's not necessary to relive the experience, just think of it and put it into your left hand.</p>
  <p> Think of something that worries you or that you're afraid of, and put it into your left hand too.</p>
  <p> What is the first color this mixture in your left hand reminds you of?</p>
  <p> What shape or form would they take in your hand?</p>
  <p> Does the mixture feel light or heavy?</p>
  <p> What sound would come from your hand, if you heard it make a sound?</p>
  <p> What texture does it feel like in your hand?</p>
  <p> What words would be uttered from that hand if it could talk to you?</p>
  <p> Now with a pouring motion, pour all the contents of your right hand into your left, like a chemist with a strange brew.</p>
  <p> As you do this notice the changes that take place in your left hand in color, sound, texture, shape, words being uttered, and the overall feelings coming from it.</p>
  <p> Now clasp your hands together for a few moments until they feel balanced.</p>
  <p> Look at the previous negative experiences in your left hand.</p>
  <p> Do you feel different about them?</p>
  <p> You should feel good or at least neutral about those experiences.</p>
  <p> If not, do it over again.</p>
  <p> OK, now in a similar way I want you to think of some famous person, friend or sage in the past or present that you like and respect very much, and put the image of that person in your right hand.</p>
  <p> Now put the image of someone you don't like or that you're upset with in your left hand.</p>
  <p> Now look at the image of the person you don't like.</p>
  <p> Now look at the person you like; then at the person you don't like; then at the person you like.</p>
  <p> Now continue very fast looking back & forth from your right hand to your left without thinking about the images as to your liking them or not.</p>
  <p> Now clasp your hands together, take a deep breath.</p>
  <p> Now what are your feelings about the person you didn't like.</p>
  <p> You should either feel good about him or at least feel alright about him.</p>
  <p> Another way of eliminating negative feelings is by increasing your energy level.</p>
  <p> The higher your energy, the more difficult it becomes to experience lower, negative emotions.</p>
  <p> Love, compassion, courage and happiness resonate with high energy, and are stimulated by wide areas of brain cells in the cerebral cortex.</p>
  <p> Lust, anger, fear and pleasure are simple, low energy emotions prompted from specific spots in the limbic system of the brain, which is brain tissue about the size of a small fist lying underneath the 2 large cerebral halves of the brain.</p>
  <p> You can increase your energy by good exercise, better nutrition, better associations, better breathing habits, better music, better drinking water, better posture and better sleep (review “<a href="GM/E151.html">Exercise 151 - Increase Your Energy, Increase Your Health</a>”).</p>
