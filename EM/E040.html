  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 40 </p><h1>Resolve Disputes In Your Favor</h1>
  <p> When emotions reign supreme, logic takes a back seat.</p>
  <p> Rarely do people argue logically.</p>
  <p> They usually argue emotionally and later they often regret it.</p>
  <p> When this happens, take advantage of it.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, you use your logical mind to resolve a dispute in your favor.</p>
  <p> First learn what not to do in an argument:</p>
  <p> 1) Don't force your will on another person.</p>
  <p> 2) Don't tell the other person he is wrong.</p>
  <p> 3) Don't order the other person to shut up and listen.</p>
  <p> 4) Don't dazzle the other person with your brilliance.</p>
  <p> 5) Don't seek someone else to side with you against the other person.</p>
  <p> Instead, do this:</p>
  <p> 1) State your viewpoint in a calm and moderate manner.</p>
  <p> 2) Assume a non-arrogant stance to disarm the other person.</p>
  <p> 3) Express a note of doubt about your own viewpoint by admitting that you might be mistaken. This halts the other person's blind opposition to your viewpoint.</p>
  <p> 4) Since you're not jamming your opinion down the other person's throat, he is now willing to see your position.</p>
  <p> 5) He now looks at your opinion rationally and begins to see the truth in it.</p>
  <p> 6) And finally, after having saved face, he argues your side of the case and shows you how your doubts are unwarranted.</p>
  <p> Now you are armed with the technique.</p>
  <p> Practice it as a daily exercise to command greater skill in handling people.</p>
  <p> It just takes practice.</p>
