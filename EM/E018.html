  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 18 </p><h1>Concentration For Better Focus</h1>
  <p> Before going to sleep, try counting backwards from 100 to 1 by projecting an imaginary white numeral onto a blackboard in your mind and see how far you get before an interrupting thought invades the process.</p>
  <p> Eventually, you'll be able to do it easily.</p>
  <p> Next, recite mentally all the multiplication tables.</p>
  <p> Go over each product taking one number at a time and recite its product.</p>
  <p> One times one is one through to one times nine.</p>
  <p> Then two times one through two times nine, etc.</p>
  <p> See if you can go through the entire multiplication table without having your mind wander off.</p>
  <p> The progress you make can be easily marked by where you strayed off in the multiplication table.</p>
