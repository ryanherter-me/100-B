  <p>EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT</p><p>Exercise 35 </p><h1>Changing Your Emotion Via Visualization</h1>
  <p> Negative and positive emotions are simply states of mind.</p>
  <p> Change your state of mind and you change the emotion.</p>
  <p> Wallowing in negative emotional states can be habit forming for some people, so this exercise will trick the negative, emotional part of the brain into relinquishing its hold.</p>
  <p> Why?</p>
  <p> Because first we're going to increase the amount of that negative emotion so that you can wallow temporarily in more of it.</p>
  <p> This exercise will also work on headaches or certain types of specific pain as well.</p>
  <p> Now lie down and relax yourself completely starting from your toes and working up to your head.</p>
  <p> Focus on deep, abdominal breathing and get comfortably relaxed.</p>
  <p> Now visualize a bright, yellow weather balloon in front of you, about 5 feet in diameter.</p>
  <p> Picture it growing bigger and bigger until it fills the room.</p>
  <p> Now visualize the balloon shrinking and shrinking down to the 5-foot size again.</p>
  <p> Increase its size and shrink it back again 2 more times.</p>
  <p> Now go through the same imaging process, but this time with your negative emotion or pain contained inside the balloon.</p>
  <p> Increase its size and feel the emotion or pain growing as you do this.</p>
  <p> Now decrease its size suddenly by punching a small hole in the side of the balloon, and envision the negative emotion or pain leaving the balloon as it completely deflates down to just an empty bright yellow balloon.</p>
  <p> Bright yellow is an uplifting color, and often has startling positive effects.</p>
  <p> You can also keep a yellow piece of construction paper (3" X 5") in your wallet or pocketbook to use as a pick-me-up during the day by just pulling it out and concentrating on it momentarily.</p>
