  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 99 </p><h1>Improving Your Kinesthetic Awareness</h1>
  <p> The kinesthetic action of typing on a typewriter requires the successful programming of a typist's brain.</p>
  <p> When a typist makes a typing mistake, a new neural pathway is established, and the same mistake is often repeated again until a conscious thought reestablishes the correct pathway.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, look into a mirror and move your various facial muscles, scalp muscles, eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth and finally your ears.</p>
  <p> (You can practice this at home while shaving or putting on your daily makeup.)</p>
  <p> Now move and bend each one of your fingers individually.</p>
  <p> Do the same with your toes after taking off your shoes and socks.</p>
  <p> While seated flex, twist or move the various muscles in your legs, stomach, chest, shoulders, back and neck.</p>
  <p> Explore yourself and direct your attention to your different muscle groups for more conscious control.</p>
  <p> Once your conscious awareness discovers or strikes upon the correct motor and neural pathways it is seeking, the kinesthetic flexing activity can be repeated and refined.</p>
  <p> In this way, some people have learned how to move their ears in different ways.</p>
  <p> When you practice this exercise, youâ€™ll soon learn that you have much more control over your muscles than you may have thought.</p>
  <p> Now print the following 10 statements on a piece of paper held on the side & without looking at it until you've finished all the statements.</p>
  <p> Print small, but use as much paper as you need.</p>
  <p> 1) I am free of fear, worry and anxiety in my life.</p>
  <p> 2) My mind is growing constantly.</p>
  <p> 3) I am becoming healthier every day in every way.</p>
  <p> 4) My enthusiasm and zest for life is increasing.</p>
  <p> 5) My self-confidence and security is improving every day.</p>
  <p> 6) I am thinking more clearly and creatively.</p>
  <p> 7) I am constantly improving myself.</p>
  <p> 8) I am achieving emotional stability and balance in my life.</p>
  <p> 9) I am youthful, strong and full of positive energy.</p>
  <p> 10) I am becoming more productive and efficient in everything I do.</p>
  <p> Look at the result.</p>
  <p> How did you do?</p>
  <p> Now transcribe the same statements on another sheet of paper, but write them in longhand this time, and take your time.</p>
  <p> Now work with a partner and take turns.</p>
  <p> Write or print in midair certain words in pantomime from the statements above and see if your partner can tell which statement you wrote.</p>
  <p> Remember, your partner will perceive them as mirror images.</p>
