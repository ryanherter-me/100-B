  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 115 </p><h1>Seeing The Human Etheric Body</h1>
  <p> Surrounding the human body are electromagnetic energy fields.</p>
  <p> The 'corona' of the human body is the etheric body, and most people can see it with only a little practice.</p>
  <p> It is the forerunner of the aura, but of a coarser consistency.</p>
  <p> One way to see it is to get a willing partner to extend a bare arm.</p>
  <p> Have their fingers outspread a few inches away from some neutral or black background.</p>
  <p> Look towards the arm and the fingers, not directly at it, but towards it.</p>
  <p> You'll soon find there is a particular knack at focusing on the background through your fingers, but seeing them with your peripheral vision.</p>
  <p> Close to the skin will be seen a bluish or grayish haze that will extend from 1/8 of an inch to maybe 6 inches from the body.</p>
  <p> Relax and don't strain the process, and pretty soon you'll see there really is something there.</p>
  <p> Another way to see the etheric body is to practice on yourself.</p>
  <p> Sit comfortably about 6 feet from a blank wall.</p>
  <p> Relax and take several deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> Extend your arms to full length and place your finger tips together with the thumbs up.</p>
  <p> Now part your fingertips slowly to about 1/4 of an inch and you will see something like a gray mist that is almost luminous.</p>
  <p> If you draw your fingers apart by another 1/4 of an inch, you'll discern the etheric body more noticeably.</p>
  <p> Keep practicing the touching and parting until you see "something."</p>
  <p> It's just a matter of practice.</p>
  <p> When you get good at it, you'll notice that it flows from either the left hand to the right hand or from the right to the left.</p>
  <p> This flow depends not only on your sex, but on your state of health as well as your thoughts at the time.</p>
  <p> Now alternate the flow back and forth with your thoughts.</p>
  <p> Another technique is to extend one index finger vertically away from your eyes and look at it.</p>
  <p> Then put your other index finger in front of the first.</p>
  <p> Begin moving the back index finger away from you slowly while focusing on its movement.</p>
  <p> After reaching arm's length, begin slowly moving it back to the first finger.</p>
  <p> Repeat the process, but this time focus on the moving finger, while directing your conscious awareness to the ghost finger (review "<a href="HS/E110.html">Exercise 110 - Improving Your Peripheral Vision Awareness</a>").</p>
  <p> Do this several times.</p>
  <p> Now reverse your hands, and repeat the process.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, close your eyes and visualize in your mind's eye this back and forth, 2-finger process.</p>
  <p> By practicing these drills, seeing the etheric body will come quickly and easily.</p>
