  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 102 </p><h1>Tactile Temperature Determination</h1>
  <p> In "<a href="/HS/E098.html">Exercise 98 - Body Temperature Control</a>," you learned how to raise or lower your body temperature.</p>
  <p> In this exercise, you will learn how to determine temperatures.</p>
  <p> In the James Bond movie, "You Only Live Twice," Bond sipped a glass of saki and determined it was correctly heated to the proper temperature of 98.4Â°F.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, heat a cup of tea or coffee and put a floating thermometer in it.</p>
  <p> After a few minutes and while looking at the immersed thermometer's temperature, taste the drink and determine for yourself what that temperature feels like.</p>
  <p> Two minutes later, do the same thing, each time keeping the thermometer in the cup and acknowledging to yourself what the temperature feels like in the mouth.</p>
  <p> Do this for several days, and then determine what the temperature is without looking first at the thermometer.</p>
  <p> How did you do?</p>
  <p> Now heat some water and pour it into a cup.</p>
  <p> With your fingers, test the water's temperature over a span of several minutes and check each time with a thermometer.</p>
  <p> Are you improving?</p>
  <p> Next, carry a thermometer with you during the day and by using your tactile awareness, determine what the temperature is at odd points during the day.</p>
  <p> Using a barometer, determine the air pressure in the same way.</p>
  <p> Indians and old woodsmen sometimes perceive these subtle differences and determine stormy weather ahead of time.</p>
  <p> One researcher claims that 30% of the general population is notably weathersensitive in some way.</p>
  <p> When the barometer drops, your body cells must lose water to adjust to changing atmospheric pressure.</p>
  <p> Because of arthritis, rheumatism or some old bone injury, inflamed or stiff body areas do not depressurize fast enough and pain is felt.</p>
  <p> Some people feel headaches or other pains debarking from a de-pressurized jet in mountainous airports for similar reasons.</p>
  <p> To help your body cells adjust faster and avoid the pain, thrust your conscious awareness into the painful area.</p>
  <p> As you learned in "<a href="/HS/E107.html">Exercise 107 - Electromagnetic Field Awareness</a>," just thinking of one of your hands increases the blood volume in that hand.</p>
  <p> Focused thought to other areas of the body can bring about an increased blood volume in those areas as well.</p>
  <p> The increased blood flow will allow your body to adjust to changing barometric pressures more smoothly.</p>
  <p> What do these exercises do for your brain?</p>
  <p> People are inundated with stimuli all day long, but fail to acknowledge the differences.</p>
  <p> Perception is blunted, instead of finely tuned.</p>
  <p> Consciously acknowledging and evaluating stimuli allows your cortical neurons to grow with more dendritic spines, thereby making associative patterns and synaptic contacts between neurons more functional.</p>
  <p> A neuron that doesn't get used is more likely to succumb to the continual dying process that goes on with your brain cells every day.</p>
