  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 94 </p><h1>Imagining Your Senses</h1>
  <p> How can you know what a state is like before you experience it?</p>
  <p> Levels of sensory acuity are also like that.</p>
  <p> For instance, your finger tips can be trained to distinguish the subtleties of braille, but before you acquired your discerning ability, your fingertips only experienced a grosser touch.</p>
  <p> When your touch becomes acute, you can remember what it was like before and the difference between then and now.</p>
  <p> The same with your visualizing acuity as it improves.</p>
  <p> You can grossly imagine something or get so acute that you can do mathematics or play chess in your head.</p>
  <p> What can you imagine in your mind's eye?</p>
  <p> How about a color beyond the range of human perception?</p>
  <p> How about a sound beyond the range of human hearing?</p>
  <p> Now let's expand your imagination through the following exercise:</p>
  <p> Imagine (Visual)</p>
  <p> -- the color of a red apple.</p>
  <p> -- the shape of a star.</p>
  <p> -- the flashing of a green strobe light.</p>
  <p> -- the number 7 on a blackboard changing into a 3 dimensional lion leaping from the blackboard.</p>
  <p> Imagine (Auditory)</p>
  <p> -- the call of a duck.</p>
  <p> -- the whistle of a train.</p>
  <p> -- the laughter of children playing.</p>
  <p> -- the din of a fog horn changing to the roar of a low flying jet overhead.</p>
  <p> Imagine (Tactile)</p>
  <p> -- the stroking of a cat.</p>
  <p> -- the tightness of grasping hands.</p>
  <p> -- the roughness of sandpaper.</p>
  <p> -- the warmth of warm water on your hands changing to snow flakes hitting your hands and melting.</p>
  <p> Imagine (Gustatory)</p>
  <p> -- the taste of chocolate ice cream.</p>
  <p> -- the carbonated flavor of a soda.</p>
  <p> -- the bitterness of strong black coffee.</p>
  <p> -- the crisp savor of an apple as you bite into it changing to a wax apple bitten into.</p>
  <p> Imagine (Olfactory)</p>
  <p> -- the odor of gasoline.</p>
  <p> -- the freshness of mint.</p>
  <p> -- the aroma of freshly cut sawdust.</p>
  <p> -- the fragrance of fresh baked bread changing to a rotten meat odor.</p>
  <p> (Kinesthetic)</p>
  <p> Imagine</p>
  <p> -- the feeling of jogging.</p>
  <p> -- the balance of tight rope walking.</p>
  <p> -- the gracefulness of waltzing.</p>
  <p> -- the movement of skiing changing into a free fall and parachuting as you ski off a cliff.</p>
  <p> Now alternate with a partner on other visualized sensations.</p>
  <p> You create one for your partner to visualize; then your partner creates one for you to visualize, and so on.</p>
