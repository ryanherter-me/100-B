  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 97 </p><h1>Improving Your Kinesthetic Instincts</h1>
  <p> In the movie, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Sundance was asked to shoot a tin can with his gun out of the holster.</p>
  <p> He took aim with his eye and missed.</p>
  <p> When he put his gun into his holster and drew from the hip, he hit the can easily and instinctively.</p>
  <p> Instinct is a catch-all word that describes an 'unconscious' activity which is hard to describe in words.</p>
  <p> If you act instinctively, you just know how to do a certain thing.</p>
  <p> In sports and games, you often develop kinesthetic instincts that enable you to play well -- dunking basketballs, shooting arrows, throwing a knife, playing darts, pitching horseshoes, etc.</p>
  <p> A man delivering consistently good tennis shots across the net is exhibiting this unconscious faculty in his accuracy.</p>
  <p> If an opponent comments to him about his remarkable play, his conscious awareness more likely will interrupt the fluidity of his kinesthetic swinging and his timing will invariably be disrupted.</p>
  <p> The spatial variables of the tennis game are more completely understood by the non-analytical side of the brain.</p>
  <p> One way to disengage the verbal, analytical side of the brain from interrupting your play is to say, "Bounce!" whenever the ball bounces, and "Hit!" whenever it hits the racket.</p>
  <p> This procedure takes your mind off the analysis of your shots.</p>
  <p> Less involved kinesthetic activities like walking, running, bicycling or shifting car gears are less easily disrupted.</p>
  <p> Balancing, juggling or doing gymnastics require more synchronized coordination.</p>
  <p> To improve your bowling or your shooting of a bow and arrow, distract the analytical side of the brain by bringing your conscious awareness to your breathing and count to 10 as you inhale.</p>
  <p> To improve your basketball, use the basket as the center of a clock.</p>
  <p> Call out your position as the time of day before you shoot.</p>
  <p> For example, as you move to the side of the basket to shoot, say to yourself, "I'm at 3 o'clock."</p>
  <p> Recite the 2's table while doing gymnastics, playing soccer or wrestling.</p>
  <p> When skiing, call out numbers to indicate the angle of your skis with the snow.</p>
  <p> Repeat an affirmation over and over while hitting a baseball or playing golf, like "I'm getting better and better."</p>
  <p> Sing a tune while fencing or shooting skeet.</p>
  <p> As an instinctive exercise for the tennis player, practice hitting tennis balls at a tin can without thinking analytically right or wrong.</p>
  <p> For the fisherman with a casting rod, chunk a practice plug into a garbage can.</p>
  <p> Then after getting good at that, plunk it into a bucket.</p>
  <p> For the hunter, use a BB rifle and shoot at small rubber balls thrown into the air (you can see a BB in flight).</p>
  <p> After that, shatter aspirins in flight!</p>
  <p> With practice, you'll acquire an inexplicable 'feel' to it.</p>
  <p> Kinesthetic adjustments will be made without your conscious evaluation, and you'll get closer and closer until you finally do it.</p>
  <p> If you try to think about your actions and exercise conscious control, you lose control.</p>
  <p> Improve the attitude of the exercise by extending excitement and enthusiasm towards the object and the lesson.</p>
  <p> Then enjoy yourself and simply let go.</p>
  <p> Japanese Buddhist monks can throw consistent bull's eyes into a dart board by using their peripheral vision alone.</p>
  <p> A football quarterback going back to pass, instinctively uses his peripheral vision to avoid on rushers while focusing his attention on the intended recipient of his pass.</p>
  <p> For instinctive practice, read something on a blackboard in front of you while throwing paper wads or coins into a bucket at varying angles to the right or left of you.</p>
  <p> Archery in the days of Robin Hood was a right brain "kinesthetic instinctiveness," not the left brain sighting-device approach of today.</p>
  <p> The 'instincts' of some martial artists are so keen that they can virtually break or catch an arrow in flight toward them.</p>
  <p> To improve kinesthetic skills, first visualize the action you want to take (see "<a href="/IT/E052.html">Exercise 52 - Improving Your Visualization Skills</a>").</p>
  <p> See and feel yourself doing it correctly.</p>
  <p> When you get good at that, you'll find that it'll only take a moment to precede the movement inwardly and you'll achieve better results.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, hold a wine glass in your left hand and pour water into it from a long necked watering can at a distance of 3 to 4 feet away without spilling a drop!</p>
  <p> Practice visualizing the action first, and soon you'll be doing it easily.</p>
  <p> Remember, the above drills are designed to make use of more of your unused potential.</p>
  <p> Whether you find an immediate use for your newly acquired skills or not is irrelevant.</p>
  <p> Pathways and avenues in the quagmires of your mind are being opened up.</p>
  <p> These in turn will lead to other areas and so forth.</p>
  <p> The more mental and physical skills that you acquire, the easier it will be to acquire others.</p>
