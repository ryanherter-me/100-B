  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 101 </p><h1>Improving Your Taste Discernment</h1>
  <p> How really discerning is your sense of taste?</p>
  <p> Are your food and beverage preferences based upon real or imagined flavor distinctions?</p>
  <p> Are you greatly influenced by advertising about a product's quality?</p>
  <p> Your taste buds are grouped in tiny bumps called papillae which make your tongue feel rough.</p>
  <p> There are about 245 taste buds to each bump in a young person.</p>
  <p> Gradually with age, this number drops to below 100.</p>
  <p> Some taste buds are scattered on the inside surface of the cheeks and on the epiglottis and on the soft palate.</p>
  <p> There are actually only 4 basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter and salty.</p>
  <p> Salt buds are along the sides of the tongue and toward the front (as are the sweet buds), while sour ones are toward the back.</p>
  <p> Bitter taste buds are at the back of the mouth itself.</p>
  <p> Heated food stimulates your taste buds, whereas cold desensitizes them.</p>
  <p> For example, before taking a bitter medicine, use a small piece of ice to chill the back of your tongue and you'll hardly taste the medicine.</p>
  <p> Also, hot, sweetened coffee tastes sweeter before it cools.</p>
  <p> Since you taste and smell food at the same time, a blending of the two senses (see "<a href="/HS/E096.html">Exercise 96 - Developing Synesthesia</a>") takes place.</p>
  <p> For example, when you say an apple "tastes good," you refer largely to its odor.</p>
  <p> If you were blindfolded and had your nose stopped up, you'd have trouble identifying raw mashed apples from raw mashed potatoes.</p>
  <p> People also eat with their eyes a lot!</p>
  <p> Purple mashed potatoes tasted terrible to most people even though the purple food coloring had no taste at all!</p>
  <p> At a scientific conference concerning the sense of taste, 100 attendants were given cherryred, but lemon flavored lollipops, and almost all of them noticed no flavor difference from its color.</p>
  <p> Do you think you can discern the difference between brewed and instant coffee?</p>
  <p> or the difference between name brands of coffee?</p>
  <p> or between the same instant coffee with or without dissolved oxygen?</p>
  <p> Tea tasters that submit quality reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration test about 500 teas a week.</p>
  <p> After swooshing a sample around in their mouth, a tea taster spits it out and compares its taste with other teas of the same type.</p>
  <p> As an exercise, take a measuring spoon and dissolve a quarter teaspoon of salt in one glass of water and a half teaspoon in a similar glass of water.</p>
  <p> Sample each by sipping, swooshing in the mouth and spitting it out.</p>
  <p> Notice the difference?</p>
  <p> Do the same with lemon juice and water; then sugar and water; then instant coffee and water.</p>
  <p> Vary the percentages and work blindfolded with friend to see if you can distinguish slightly higher and lower levels when given them.</p>
  <p> Then combine the tastes and distinguish the same higher or lower levels when in combination with each other.</p>
  <p> The next time you eat a meal, take the time to savor the flavor combinations in your mouth.</p>
  <p> Sample new food dishes, fruits and vegetables to enhance your taste experience.</p>
  <p> Imagine yourself in the country of each food's origin.</p>
  <p> Involve yourself in each new sensory experiment and consciously BE with the experience.</p>
  <p> While holding your nose and closing your eyes, have an assistant put diced up carrots, apple, potato, turnip and onion in your mouth for identification.</p>
  <p> Next, taste creamy things -- yogurt, ice cream, peanut butter, creamy potatoes, sour cream and pudding.</p>
  <p> Then try a teaspoon of milk, orange juice, coffee, wine and water.</p>
  <p> How acute is your taste without your eyes and nose?</p>
  <p> Could you discern a mashed apple taste while smelling a fragrant pear?</p>
