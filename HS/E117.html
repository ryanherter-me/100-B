  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 117 </p><h1>Numbing Touch For Pain Control</h1>
  <p> This exercise should only be learned after "<a href="EM/E027.html">Exercise 27 - Achieving Autonomic Muscle Control (Limb Heaviness)</a>" has been mastered.</p>
  <p> Assume a relaxed, comfortable position and do some deep, abdominal breathing.</p>
  <p> Now suggest to yourself that your right hand is becoming heavy, cold and numb.</p>
  <p> Visualize putting your right hand into ice water.</p>
  <p> Experience the feeling as it gets colder and number.</p>
  <p> Imagine your hand freezing cold.</p>
  <p> Reiterate to yourself, "My right hand is becoming heavy, cold and numb."</p>
  <p> Keep repeating the suggestion until it becomes cold and numb.</p>
  <p> Now take the 1st two fingers of your right hand and touch the top of your left hand and say, "The area I'm touching with my fingers is also becoming cold and numb."</p>
  <p> Repeat the suggestion until numbness occurs.</p>
  <p> Test the area with your fingernails into the skin.</p>
  <p> Now touch any area of your body with your numb hand and anesthetize the site.</p>
  <p> Learn this technique before you get a pain so it can be called upon when necessary.</p>
