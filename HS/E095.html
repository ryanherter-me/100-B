  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 95 </p><h1>Experiencing Another Person’s Senses</h1>
  <p> Sometimes we are so engrossed with our own sensory viewpoint that we neglect to realize that others may experience things differently.</p>
  <p> Each person's senses differ in their sensitivity and perceptual interpretation.</p>
  <p> Since people absorb the same sensory information in different ways, our personal realities are different.</p>
  <p> For this exercise, secure a friend that is willing to relate to you what he or she is experiencing in a sensory way.</p>
  <p> Now take a walk or a drive or go to a restaurant and relate to each other what you are seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing and feeling as you experience each sensory activity.</p>
  <p> Most people all too often neglect to relate to another person what they experience in a sensory way.</p>
  <p> By doing so, extraordinary differences can be picked up and an enrichment of the experience can be added.</p>
  <p> When two people do the same thing, it's not the same thing at all.</p>
