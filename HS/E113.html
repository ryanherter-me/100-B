  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 113 </p><h1>Eyeless Sight</h1>
  <p> As we learn more about the body's capabilities in conjunction with the mind, a new physiology is unfolding in the world.</p>
  <p> The hocus pocus about ESP (extrasensory perception) is evolving out of the realm of mysticism and occultism and into the world of science.</p>
  <p> In other words, as our instrumentation improves, we're beginning to measure and explain things that formerly were mysteries.</p>
  <p> Under hypnosis, people proceed much faster in the training process of finger and skin perception, because they accept the power of suggestion and believe they can do it.</p>
  <p> It also has been found that if your finger temperature is down to around 70° 75°F, your perception is off a bit.</p>
  <p> If your finger temperature is over 90°F and the colored construction paper is at room temperature, your perception is heightened (review "<a href="/HS/E112.html">Exercise 112 - Seeing With Your Skin & Body</a>").</p>
  <p> In fact, experiments reveal that the greater the difference between the temperature of the hand and the temperature of the object, the better the result.</p>
  <p> For a simple exercise, paint one side of an aluminum square black and put it into the freezer.</p>
  <p> Drop the temperature of the plate to about 40°F.</p>
  <p> Now while blindfolded have an assistant let you feel the air just above the black painted side without touching it.</p>
  <p> Now feel the air just above the unpainted side.</p>
  <p> Notice a definite feeling of draft on your fingers on the painted side?!</p>
  <p> This is simply an exaggerated example of what is perceived on a finer level with colors at room temperature.</p>
  <p> Now sit facing a partner (preferably of the opposite sex) across a table and get into a comfortable, relaxed position.</p>
  <p> Blindfold yourself with a black sleep mask and pass your hand a few inches in front of your face.</p>
  <p> While moving your hand from side to side, sense your hand by imagining it as it moves.</p>
  <p> Work with the other hand the same way.</p>
  <p> Now hold hands with your partner.</p>
  <p> Have your partner move her hand in front of your face and around the side of your head.</p>
  <p> Perceive it in your mind.</p>
  <p> Feel it.</p>
  <p> Imagine it.</p>
  <p> Let her stop her hand in various positions and you tell her where it is.</p>
  <p> Now you put your hands to the sides of the table.</p>
  <p> Have your partner touch your forehead with her hand and then place it on the table somewhere in front of you.</p>
  <p> When she says, "Go," you immediately touch her hand with your finger.</p>
  <p> Let your partner put a sponge on the table in front of you.</p>
  <p> Now have your partner pass your hand over areas of the table to see if you can discern a difference when it passes over the sponge.</p>
  <p> Use other household objects.</p>
  <p> Practice pointing at and picking up the objects while blindfolded.</p>
  <p> Brush your teeth, comb your hair and wash yourself in the shower with your eyes closed.</p>
  <p> If you practice these drills a lot, you’ll eventually get results.</p>
