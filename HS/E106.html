  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 106 </p><h1>Kinesthetic Weight Determination</h1>
  <p> Have you ever picked up two grapefruits that looked alike, but felt like a different weight in each of your hands?</p>
  <p> The next time you are at a supermarket, practice with such fruits and simply determine for yourself which one is heavier; then confirm it on the weight scale.</p>
  <p> Using a delicate balancing scale at home, do the same thing with dissimilar, but smaller objects -- matches, pens, pencils, smoking pipes, spoons, etc.</p>
  <p> Hold one in each hand and ascertain for yourself the weight differences of each object.</p>
  <p> You'll probably find that the larger, and heavier items are easier to decipher, but practice will allow even the subtle weight differences of smaller objects to be determined as well.</p>
  <p> Then by feel alone, determine the exact weight of single objects.</p>
  <p> You can also fill similar glasses with different amounts of water and discern the heaviest to lightest ones with your eyes closed.</p>
  <p> Remember these exercises are designed to make use of the latent areas of your brain.</p>
  <p> Whether you find an immediate use for your newly acquired skills or not is irrelevant.</p>
  <p> Pathways and avenues in the quagmires of the mind are being opened up.</p>
  <p> These in turn will lead to other areas and so forth.</p>
  <p> The more mental and physical skills that you acquire, the easier it will be to acquire others.</p>
