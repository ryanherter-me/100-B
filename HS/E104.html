  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 104 </p><h1>Improving The Tactile Awareness Of Your Toes</h1>
  <p> Theodore A. Nichols is an armless man that worked for the FBI.</p>
  <p> Using only his toes, he typed, drove an unmodified car with an automatic stick shift, pitched softball and did all his own household chores.</p>
  <p> Many armless individuals have learned to use typewriters and other machines and instruments with the dexterity of their feet alone!</p>
  <p> While blindfolded, have an assistant give you familiar objects to feel with your toes and feet for identification.</p>
  <p> First use the left foot, then the right, then both together.</p>
  <p> Notice a difference?</p>
  <p> Using wooden blocks with numbers and letters, discern all the letters and numbers blindfolded, using the toes of one and then the other foot.</p>
  <p> Next, differentiate with your toes the difference between coarse, medium and fine sandpaper, using each foot.</p>
  <p> Was your left, or your right foot better able to perceive the tactile differences?</p>
  <p> Harry Houdini could pick locks with a thin wire and his feet alone!</p>
  <p> As an exercise at home in your bare feet, separate and close all your toes.</p>
  <p> Then move each toe individually in turn as best as you can.</p>
  <p> Practice flushing the toilet, turning on bath tub faucets and picking up dropped objects or pieces of clothing with your toes alone.</p>
  <p> Remember that all the sensory input from these exercises is bringing about changes in your brain.</p>
  <p> It's being developed in areas not normally used extensively.</p>
  <p> Such new connective pathways make additional learning easier and life more interesting, because your body/mind combination is becoming more consciously controllable.</p>
