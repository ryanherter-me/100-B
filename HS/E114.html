  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 114 </p><h1>Vibrational Sight</h1>
  <p> With a group of 6 to 8 people, designate a leader and blindfold the rest.</p>
  <p> Choose a location where disturbances are minimal and the people can be fed and housed for the night.</p>
  <p> In the beginning, only blindfold the people for a few hours at a time to get them used to visual deprivation.</p>
  <p> Give them snacks or breaks during these interims, then cover their eyes with the blindfolds again.</p>
  <p> In the early stages, most of the people will move around with great caution, adding an occasional stumble or bump now and then.</p>
  <p> Soon afterwards, a distorted sense of time develops along with a changing perception of where the walls and furniture in the room are situated.</p>
  <p> At this point, sound, touch and fragrances become necessary tools in determining your orientation.</p>
  <p> Since normally about 80% of all your sensory input is visual, that 80% has to now shift to your other senses.</p>
  <p> Several hours through the exercise, you begin to move about with greater speed.</p>
  <p> Twilight glimmers of the outside world and the people around the room begin to unlock your inner perceptions of awareness.</p>
  <p> Have the people sleep blindfolded, and on the second day, eat blindfolded as well.</p>
  <p> You will begin to experience on the second day an awareness through vibrations.</p>
  <p> Objects, furniture and walls seem to announce themselves upon approach.</p>
  <p> Movements outside among the trees and shrubs also become surer and quicker as the realm of vibrational sight expands itself.</p>
  <p> It must be mentioned here that it is extremely important to have the right guide during this exercise, for feelings of panic and helplessness can easily invade your consciousness.</p>
  <p> Also, if you have had a problem with mental instability, this exercise is not recommended.</p>
  <p> After completing this exercise, your appreciation and perception in the sighted world will be greatly heightened, because you will always remember what the 'shift' to the other senses felt like.</p>
