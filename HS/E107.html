  <p>HEIGHTENED SENSORY </p><p> Exercise 107 </p><h1>Electromagnetic Field Awareness</h1>
  <p> Have you ever entered a room just after someone had an angry bout with someone else, and detected the angry energy in the air?</p>
  <p> Have you ever been near someone seriously unstable and picked up on it even when his or her back was toward you?</p>
  <p> Even areas of certain cities simply radiate a bad energy around them that is perceivable to some people.</p>
  <p> You have various energy fields surrounding your body that are directly tied into the beating of your heart.</p>
  <p> These energies course through you, interacting with body chemistry, and are distributed throughout your body via the 7 subtle energy centers called chakras.</p>
  <p> By regulating the distance in extending your energy fields, your sensitivity to them and your control over them can be heightened.</p>
  <p> Sit or lie down in a comfortable, relaxed position and take a few deep, abdominal breaths.</p>
  <p> Do "<a href="/EM/E023.html">Exercise 23 - Cleansing Breath For Better Health</a>" to charge up your body.</p>
  <p> Then completely relax yourself and tune into the energy radiating from your body (see the “life energy” measuring device in the back of the book).</p>
  <p> Imagine it pulsating in a wave-like action and sense the feeling of it emanating from your body.</p>
  <p> Now imagine that you are expanding this energy field to about 3 feet from your body.</p>
  <p> Put your conscious awareness into it and let it flow outward.</p>
  <p> Gradually expand it some more until it reaches 9 feet from your body.</p>
  <p> Visualize how this would look and continue to expand it even further to about 15 feet from your body.</p>
  <p> To assist the process, create an excited, positive, emotional attitude while doing it.</p>
  <p> Now slowly pull the energy field back to your body in a progressive way, but this time draw it in even closer than it normally would be.</p>
  <p> To contract the field, create a glum, negative, emotional attitude.</p>
  <p> Next, relax the energy field contraction and let it go back to its normal size.</p>
  <p> After practice with this exercise, your awareness of your energy fields will improve as well as your sensitivity to other fields around you.</p>
  <p> By projecting a stream of energy, a Chinese qigong master can kill, stun or knock someone down from a distance of up to 10 feet away.</p>
  <p> When masters use their fingertips or hands to relieve pain or heal someone, their energy is temporarily drained afterwards.</p>
  <p> ("And Jesus said, somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."</p>
  <p> Luke 8:46) The Soviet Nina Kulagina could focus her energy to perform psychokinetic demonstrations -- even to the point of stopping the heart of a frog.</p>
  <p> There is also fatigue and an energy drain experienced by people after performing psychokinetic feats.</p>
  <p> Just as your physical body is controlled by your mind, so too is the electromagnet- ic energy field surrounding your body directed by the power of your thoughts.</p>
  <p> Thought precedes your bodily actions -- whether they are gross or subtle.</p>
  <p> An old magician's "mind-reading" trick is to have you think about and concentrate on one of your hands.</p>
  <p> The magician then subtly holds both of your hands and lightly places one of his fingers on your pulse.</p>
  <p> Magicians have long known that your blood volume increases markedly in the hand that you are thinking of.</p>
  <p> Your pulse will first slow down (it seems to skip a beat), and then with a sudden surge, it will throb with more force.</p>
  <p> Consequently, a distinct difference is discernible by touching the pulses of both wrists, and the "mind reading" trick of determining which hand you are thinking about is achieved.</p>
  <p> Obviously, what applies to the hands also applies to other areas of the body, and what applies to blood flow also applies to other bodily capacities.</p>
  <p> Light and radio waves are other forms of electromagnetic energy.</p>
  <p> Various colors in the light spectrum cause distinct reactions in people (see "<a href="/GM/E222.html">Exercise 222 - Color Significance</a>").</p>
  <p> People exposed to directional radar beams (a form of radio wave) report a 'hearing' sensation described as a buzzing sound in the temporal lobe of the brain.</p>
  <p> When exposed to radar guns, people test weak kinesiologically for up to 100 yards away (see "<a href="/GM/E142.html">Exercise 142 - Improve Your Physical Strength In 7 Days</a>"), so obviously the body is reacting to radar (a form of microwave) on some subtle level.</p>
  <p> If an emotional message was directed through the radar gun by the person transmitting, could the receiver discern it with enough training?</p>
  <p> Could radar guns be modified to pulse at frequencies that scramble, disrupt and confuse all those caught in their beams?</p>
  <p> Perhaps radar guns could be further modified to immobilize or stun a charging bull in full stride, or a running felon for that matter?</p>
  <p> Could pulsed, focused beams from simple radar guns be keyed to a desired frequency for a desired effect?</p>
  <p> Besides electromagnetic energy, many people accumulate 10,000 to 20,000 volts of static electricity while walking across a deep pile carpet on a dry day.</p>
  <p> Electrostatic instruments can measure this energy via the cloud of ions (charged particles) surrounding the human body.</p>
  <p> Some people are "allergic" to electrostatic fields and react very strongly to them.</p>
  <p> On the other hand, Pauline Shaw of Manchester, England accumulates so much static electricity in her body that she blows out electrical appliances with just a touch.</p>
  <p> This electrostatic energy may also be partially responsible for establishing the initial stages of psychokinesis (see "<a href="GM/E195.html">Exercise 195 - Psychokinesis</a>") in some people.</p>
  <p> Psychokinetic Nina Kulagina for instance could easily light up fluorescent lights with her static discharge.</p>
