  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 138 </p><h1>Sentence Intermingling</h1>
  <p> Your visualization powers have improved greatly after mastering all the preceding word exercises.</p>
  <p> You are now looking at words quickly and completely.</p>
  <p> You are operating on a multi-track thinking level, instead of one-track thinking level.</p>
  <p> Now think of two short 3-word sentences and intermingle one forwards and the other backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, "Kindness is better" and "Love is beautiful" become: LroevtetiesbbseiasusteinfdunliK Next, think of two 3-word sentences and intermingle both of them backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, "Think in color" and "Emotions can kill" become: rlolliokcnnaicksnniohiTtomE Now think of two 4-word sentences and intermingle one forwards and the other backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, "Mental effort can help" and "Let us vary techniques" become: sMeeunqtianlhecfeftoyrrtacvasnuhteelLp Next, think of two 4-word sentences and intermingle both of them backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, "Thinking is not habitual" and "Breathing is far easier" become: rleaiustaiebraahftsoingsniighntiakenriBhT Practice these drills until they become easy for you.</p>
  <p> Devote at least 30 to 60 minutes per day to them and choose 30 different sentence pairs each day for each drill.</p>
