  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 134 </p><h1>Back & Forth Word Intermingling</h1>
  <p> Your mind is growing in strength and clarity.</p>
  <p> You are seeing the world with more mental aptitude now.</p>
  <p> Make sure you have mastered "<a href="MT/E133.html">Exercise 133 - Multiple Word Intermingling</a>" before attempting this one.</p>
  <p> Now write a list of six 6-letter words again, but this time write the 1st three 6letter words in a forward order and the last three in a backward order like so: MENTAL STRIVE OBTAIN TEKRAM THGUOS RETNEC Memorize your list as it looks on your paper and then remove it from view.</p>
  <p> Now without looking back at your list, begin writing the 1st letter of the 1st word, the 1st letter of the 2nd word, 1st of the 3rd word and then with the 4th, 5th and 6th words - the last letters.</p>
  <p> For instance, choosing the above words, the drill would begin like this: MSOTTR.</p>
  <p> By holding a picture of your list in your mind's eye, continue writing in a similar fashion as in "<a href="MT/E133.html">Exercise 133 - Multiple Word Intermingling</a>."</p>
  <p> The line of letters on the above example would appear like this, if done correctly: MS O T T R E T B E H E N R T K G T T I A R U N A V I A O E L E N M S C 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 Spend 30 to 60 minutes each day on this drill until you can write easily and flowingly all the letters in a line.</p>
  <p> Every time, work only from memory and create new word lists each day, but practice it until you get it.</p>
