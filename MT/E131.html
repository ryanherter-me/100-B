  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 131 </p><h1>4-Letter Word Intermingling</h1>
  <p> After completing "<a href="MT/E130.html">Exercise 130 - 3-Letter Word Intermingling</a>," you can proceed with this exercise in mind development.</p>
  <p> Think first of a 3-letter word and a 4-letter word.</p>
  <p> Now write them down in a forward sequence intermingled.</p>
  <p> Thus, A - R - T and L E - N - D become LAERNTD.</p>
  <p> Practice this drill with 30 different pairs of words until you can do it smoothly.</p>
  <p> Next, intermingle two 4-letter words in a forward sequence like so: W - A - K - E and D - I - S - H become WDAIKSEH.</p>
  <p> Do this drill with 30 different word pairs.</p>
  <p> Now intermingle two 4-letter words -- one forwards and the other backwards like so: L - A - R - K and E - A - S - Y become LYASRAKE or EKARSAYL.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 30 times with different words.</p>
  <p> Next, intermingle two 4-letter words in a backward sequence like so: H - O - M E and L - I - K - E become EEMKOIHL.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 30 times with different words.</p>
  <p> With the completion of this exercise, your mind should be feeling more awake and versatile.</p>
  <p> By achieving this mental development, solutions to your everyday problems are found more easily.</p>
  <p> When devoting 30 to 60 minutes per day on this exercise, begin utilizing odd moments during the day while waiting for an appointment or during your lunch break.</p>
  <p> Understand how to utilize all your daily time effectively and efficiently.</p>
