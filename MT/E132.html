  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 132 </p><h1>5-Letter Word Calisthenics</h1>
  <p> By increasing the difficulty of each exercise gradually, your inner visualization process is broadened progressively.</p>
  <p> After mastering "Exercise 4-Letter Word Intermingling," this exercise can be handled easily.</p>
  <p> Begin by writing 50 five-letter words on a sheet of paper backwards and memorize them.</p>
  <p> Remove the list and think of two 5-letter words.</p>
  <p> Now write one forwards, while spelling the other backwards aloud.</p>
  <p> For example, write B - L - A Z - E and spell M - R - A - L - A.</p>
  <p> Do the drill 20 times with different pairs of words.</p>
  <p> Now reverse the procedure and write one 5-letter word backwards and spell aloud another one forwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write S - T - S - E - T and spell C - A - R - T S.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times with different words.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 5-letter words and intermingle one forwards and the other backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, S - T - A - R - T and B - E - G - I - N become SNTIAGRETB or BTERGAITNS.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 30 times with different words.</p>
  <p> Next, intermingle two 5-letter words in a backward sequence like so: S - A - V E - D and B - R - E - A - K become DKEAVEARSB.</p>
  <p> Do this drill with 30 sets of words.</p>
  <p> Do these drills for 30 to 60 minutes per day or until all of them can be done with ease.</p>
  <p> With the completion of this exercise, your clarity and alertness will amaze you.</p>
  <p> More of your brain cells are becoming accessible to you, and your interaction with them is improving daily.</p>
