  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 129 </p><h1>4-Letter Word Calisthenics</h1>
  <p> After completing "<a href="MT/E128.html">Exercise 128 - 3-Letter Word Calisthenics</a>," writing and spelling 3letter words in any order should be a snap.</p>
  <p> Your mind is more flexible and your visualization processes are keener.</p>
  <p> Now write 30 four-letter words backwards on a sheet of paper.</p>
  <p> Remove the list, and keep writing them on fresh sheets of paper until you have completely memorized the list.</p>
  <p> Now think of one of the 4-letter words and write it backwards, while spelling it forwards aloud.</p>
  <p> For example, write E - M - A - T and spell aloud T - A - M - E.</p>
  <p> Do the drill 20 times, using a different 4-letter word each time.</p>
  <p> Now reverse the procedure and write a 4-letter word forwards, while spelling the same word backwards.</p>
  <p> Practice 20 times with 20 different words.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 4-letter words and write one forwards, while spelling the other one forwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write M - I - N - D and spell aloud L - I - K - E.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times, using different 4-letter words each time.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 4-letter words and write one forwards, while spelling the other one backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write M - I - N - T and spell aloud D - L - O - G.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times, using different 4-letter words each time.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 4-letter words and write one backwards, while spelling the other one forwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write D - N - E - S and spell aloud C - A - R - E.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 4-letter words and write one backwards, while spelling the other one backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write E - N - I - L and spell aloud D - N - I - K.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times.</p>
  <p> These mind expanding drills must be mastered before proceeding with succeeding exercises.</p>
  <p> Your mental 'muscles' are being flexed and portions of your brain are being developed so that a 'sensory overload' is far less likely in the future.</p>
  <p> Commit 30 - 60 minutes per day to this exercise or until you can do all the drills without hesitation.</p>
