  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 123 </p><h1>A Multiple Hearing Acuity</h1>
  <p> Neural ear cells were once considered as irreplaceable as neural brain cells -- once destroyed, no replacements could be grown thereafter.</p>
  <p> The loud noises of guns, rock music and big machinery all can obliterate ear neurons.</p>
  <p> Can being more conscious of sounds improve auditory acuity?</p>
  <p> One researcher found that those people who enjoy loud music or "attend" more to it suffer less hearing loss from it than those who don't enjoy it.</p>
  <p> By directing your conscious awareness to a finely tuned listening discernment, there is a more refined usage of the ears, and corresponding brain centers governing the ears.</p>
  <p> To assume that because you have ears, you are listening and attending to sound is just as absurd as to assume that because you have a brain, you are thinking.</p>
  <p> Both skills are learned with practice.</p>
  <p> If neither ear or brain cells are put to much use, naturally their rate of deterioration will be increased with their corresponding lack of use.</p>
  <p> Since about 80% of your acknowledged sensory input is visual, much of the auditory information coming into your brain goes consciously unnoticed.</p>
  <p> Can deteriorating unused cells in the brain's hearing center contribute to a hearing loss?</p>
  <p> Some people have hearing that is so attuned that they can play a musical instrument totally "by ear" Mozart could hear a piece once, and play it perfectly from memory alone.</p>
  <p> Even though some people have neural connections more naturally adapted to a sense of perfect pitch than others, research has shown that training can make the ability of absolute pitch available to anyone, and regardless of their musical inclinations.</p>
  <p> It does seem though that reading the language of musical notes is a left brain function, which is why some 'idiot savants' with left brain impairment have learned to play instruments only 'by ear' (a right brain function).</p>
  <p> One young man learned the long distance sound tones of the telephone company so well, he could simulate them in a phone booth without depositing any money, but simply by whistling!</p>
  <p> Work with a partner and a touch button phone.</p>
  <p> As your partner touches each button, you discern the number being pressed.</p>
  <p> This tonal discernment can be picked up rather quickly.</p>
  <p> Next, using a rotary style phone, have your partner dial each digit.</p>
  <p> Get used to the sound of the clicks for each number so that eventually you can tell any phone number by just the sound of its being dialed.</p>
  <p> Now do either operation while talking or listening to someone.</p>
  <p> The blind frequently identify everyday sounds with great clarity.</p>
  <p> As an exercise with your back turned or with your eyes closed, have a partner do different things involving sounds for identification -- open a briefcase, pop in a cassette to a recorder, tap on a light bulb, thump a book, etc.</p>
  <p> Next, converse with your partner and have him continue initiating the various sound inputs -- dropping a paper clip, scraping the floor, etc.</p>
  <p> Afterwards, identify the various sounds that you heard while you were conversing.</p>
  <p> Continue with this and vary the sound effects from items to include crinkling, crackling, hissing, sizzling, creaking, soft whizzing, whirring, flapping and tearing.</p>
  <p> In a country field, on a city street, or at a beach location, practice for 5 minutes with your eyes closed identifying distant and nearby sounds -- picking each one out, one at a time.</p>
  <p> Now embrace them together by switching your conscious awareness very rapidly back and forth from one to another until a unified mixing is achieved.</p>
  <p> Listen to a symphony recording and pick out each instrument being played.</p>
  <p> Then simply appreciate the entire blend.</p>
  <p> You can do this just like you can recognize your name spoken in a crowded room or you can embrace all the conversations at once.</p>
  <p> If this drill is done in a group, you'll find that other people will pick up things that you missed and vice versa.</p>
  <p> Many people can learn to discern one musician from another just by their individual playing style.</p>
  <p> Blindfold yourself and have an assistant drop a coin on the floor.</p>
  <p> What denomination is it?</p>
  <p> Now drop 2 coins.</p>
  <p> What denominations are they?</p>
  <p> Increase the number of coins and vary the combinations.</p>
  <p> Have your assistant drop certain pieces of silverware with the coins and discern the differences and their identities.</p>
  <p> Throw a paper wad into various sizes of empty bowls, pans and other containers and determine the size of the container by the resounding sound.</p>
  <p> Always have a mental set ready for absorbing your auditory information and you'll be surprised how easy it will become to increase your awareness.</p>
  <p> Learn to visualize sounds and replay them in your mind after you hear them, and your recall of them later will improve.</p>
  <p> Those older people suffering from memory loss can certainly benefit from these challenging discernment exercises.</p>
  <p> In fact, many such drugs could be used in conjunction with physical exercise for stroke victims.</p>
