  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 137 </p><h1>Backward Sentence Writing</h1>
  <p> As you master each one of these mind expanding exercises, you'll probably realize that your potential capabilities are far greater than you originally suspected.</p>
  <p> Having gotten this far, you now have a good sense of accomplishment and achievement.</p>
  <p> Now think of a short sentence to yourself and write the letters and words backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, "My mind is growing strong" becomes "gnorts gniworg si dnim yM."</p>
  <p> Do this with 30 different sentences.</p>
  <p> As you become increasingly more proficient with writing sentences backwards, increase their word and sentence length.</p>
  <p> You can even practice this while going to and from work.</p>
  <p> Look at billboard signs for a second; then spell the sentences you see there backwards to yourself.</p>
  <p> This is also another way of utilizing those odd moments during the day.</p>
  <p> Practice this exercise 30 to 60 minutes each day or until it becomes easy for you to do.</p>
