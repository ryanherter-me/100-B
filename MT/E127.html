  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 127 </p><h1>Alphabet Gymnastics</h1>
  <p> Let’s do a drill to limber up your mind for the exercise to follow.</p>
  <p> Have a partner begin uttering words from 6 to 15 letters long and you guess as fast as you can the number of letters in each word after your partner utters it.</p>
  <p> After doing 20 or 30 words this way, proceed to the exercise below.</p>
  <p> This is an exercise to prepare you for the exercises to come.</p>
  <p> Take a sheet of paper and PRINT the alphabet in block letters and visualize each letter as you do this.</p>
  <p> Then look away and hold the entire alphabet in your mind's eye.</p>
  <p> Keep looking back at it and then away again until you succeed.</p>
  <p> Now remove the sheet of paper and print the whole alphabet backwards from memory alone.</p>
  <p> Then check for mistakes and write the alphabet backwards again.</p>
  <p> Keep repeating the process, but each time without looking at previous attempts.</p>
  <p> Do this until you can write the alphabet backwards 20 times perfectly.</p>
  <p> Now while visualizing the alphabet in its forward order, intermingle the order of the alphabet in a 1-3, 2-4, 5-7, 6-8 fashion.</p>
  <p> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W 24 25 26 X Y Z Becomes: A C B D E G F H I K J L M O N P Q S R T U W V X Y Z Do this drill each time from memory alone until you can write the sequence successfully 20 times.</p>
  <p> If you mastered the preceding drills, this one should flex your mind's potential a little.</p>
  <p> Now hold the alphabet in your mind's eye and transpose the alphabet backwards in a 26-24, 25-23, 22-20, 21-19 manner.</p>
  <p> 26 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F 5 4 3 2 1 E D C B A Becomes: Z X Y W V T U S R P Q O N L M K J H I G F D E C B A Copying will not strengthen your mind, so do this drill from memory 20 times perfectly.</p>
  <p> Now for the final drill in this exercise, transpose the letters of the alphabet in a 126, 2-25, 3-24 order.</p>
  <p> It should look like this: A Z B Y C X D W E V F U G T H S I R J Q K P L O M N Do this drill 20 times in succession perfectly, but remember -- from memory only each time.</p>
  <p> From the “<a href="MT/E127.html">Exercise 127 - Alphabet Gymnastics</a>” pivot many of the exercises to follow, so make sure you master this exercise first.</p>
  <p> If you apply yourself towards these exercises with sincerity, a versatile, multiple mentality will be your reward.</p>
  <p> Your mind will learn to do what formerly you thought was impossible for you to do!</p>
