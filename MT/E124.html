  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 124 </p><h1>Learning To Be Ambidextrous</h1>
  <p> Ambidexterity is the ability to use both your hands with equal ease or facility, but if you're armless, it could be your feet!</p>
  <p> In fact, it is quite advantageous in certain sports and martial arts to be able to use both your feet with equal facility.</p>
  <p> The Greeks encouraged and tried to promote ambidexterity because it was simply logical in sports and battle to be adept with both hands instead of one.</p>
  <p> By combining the Phoenician style of writing right to left with their own left to right system, the Greeks created a reading and writing system called boustrophedon, where the lines ran alternately right-to-left and left-to-right.</p>
  <p> With alternating sweeps of the eyes back and forth, reading was more swift and efficient.</p>
  <p> Michelangelo (1475-1564) was a multi-faceted genius like Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
  <p> He often painted with both hands.</p>
  <p> When one got tired, he switched to the other.</p>
  <p> British artist, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802-1873) could draw with both hands simultaneously -- a horse's head with one hand and a stag's head with the other.</p>
  <p> He taught drawing and etching to Queen Victoria who was a lefty that became ambidextrous.</p>
  <p> Fleming, Einstein and Tesla were all ambidextrous.</p>
  <p> Benjamin Franklin was also ambidextrous and signed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution with his left hand.</p>
  <p> U.S. 20th president, James Garfield was a well educated backwoodsman born in a log cabin.</p>
  <p> Although he could write with either hand with equal ease, he could also write Greek with his left hand and Latin with his right hand simultaneously!</p>
  <p> Harry Kahne demonstrated his mental dexterity in 1922 by performing several mental operations simultaneously.</p>
  <p> While one hand was writing mirror language, the other hand intermingled upside down and backward letters.</p>
  <p> Rats given diverse and enriched environments have more connective dendritic spines to their neurons and overall heavier brains than rats exposed to dull, unchallenging environments.</p>
  <p> Left-handed and ambidextrous people have 11% larger corpus callosa (the bundle of nerve fibers joining the right and left sides of the brain) than right handed people.</p>
  <p> An autopsy of Einstein's brain revealed a larger profusion of superficial capillaries interlacing the cerebral cortex than the average brain, as well as an additional amount of glial cells.</p>
  <p> Obviously the more we use and exercise our brain, the more it physically grows.</p>
  <p> The following exercises are designed to task the little used areas of the brain to allow such growth.</p>
  <p> To be able to use both hands equally well, practice is the key.</p>
  <p> During the day, use your left hand more (if you're right-handed) by consciously switching when you're about ready to do something -- pouring a glass of milk, bouncing a ball, flipping and picking up coins, hammering a nail, cutting and buttering bread, stirring your coffee, swirling water in a glass, twisting off bottle caps, etc.</p>
  <p> Wherever you would use your one hand, use the other instead -- putting a key in the door, combing your hair, brushing your teeth, shaving, grasping objects, etc.</p>
  <p> When putting on your clothes, put your other hand or foot into the garment first.</p>
  <p> Thread your belt around your waist in the opposite direction.</p>
  <p> Put your watch on your other hand.</p>
  <p> Use your other hand in sports -- hitting a baseball or a tennis ball, throwing a football, shooting a basketball, etc.</p>
  <p> Practice stirring 2 cups of tea simultaneously, swirling 2 half filled glasses of water clockwise and counterclockwise, and bouncing two balls at the same time.</p>
  <p> Get used to the kinesthetic feeling of using the muscles of both your hands and arms together.</p>
  <p> Catch 2 balls thrown to you at the same time.</p>
  <p> Throw 2 paper wads at the same time into the same paper basket -- one underhand and the other overhand.</p>
  <p> Throw 2 darts simultaneously at a dart board with both hands.</p>
  <p> Write with both hands at the same time (review "<a href="MT/E125.html">Exercise 125 - Writing Mirror Language</a>").</p>
  <p> Draw a butterfly, a vase or a geometric figure using both hands simultaneously, but keep practicing these exercises.</p>
  <p> Many musical instruments are played ambidextrously, and many athletes are adept at using both of their hands.</p>
  <p> Since swimming is an ambidextrous activity, teaching dyslectic children to swim often helps them to read and write normally because it balances the brain hemispheres.</p>
  <p> Become ambidextrous and along with an added physiological brain growth, a more balanced integration of your 2 hemispheres will be achieved.</p>
  <p> Studies have shown that ambidextrous people are more emotionally independent, more determined, more adaptable to new situations and more apt to handle problems without giving up.</p>
