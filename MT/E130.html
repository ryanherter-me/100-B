  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 130 </p><h1>3-Letter Word Intermingling</h1>
  <p> After mastering "<a href="/MT/E129.html">Exercise 129 - 4-Letter Word Calisthenics</a>," you are now ready for more mind manipulation.</p>
  <p> Think of any two 3-letter words and write them on a sheet of paper by intermingling their forward sequence.</p>
  <p> Thus, A - R - K and O - D - D become AORDKD.</p>
  <p> Practice this until you can smoothly write 30 different pairs of intermingled 3-letter words without hesitation.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 3-letter words and intermingle one forwards and the other backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, T - O - N and I - C - E become TEOCNI or NIOCTE.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 30 times with different words.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 3-letter words and intermingle one backwards and the other backwards too.</p>
  <p> For example, L - E - T and I - N - K become KTNEIL or TKENLI.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 30 times with different words.</p>
  <p> By mastering these drills, you stop coddling your brain.</p>
  <p> You're stretching its potential in a progressive fashion.</p>
  <p> You're on the road to greater mental development.</p>
  <p> Devote 30 to 60 minutes a day to these drills until they are mastered.</p>
