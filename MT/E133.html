  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 133 </p><h1>Multiple Word Intermingling</h1>
  <p> By this time, reading things backwards or even upside down should not provide a problem.</p>
  <p> Make sure all preceding word exercises have been mastered thoroughly before proceeding with this one though.</p>
  <p> If you have jumped ahead of any of the previous exercises in any way, it will be revealed now.</p>
  <p> Ready?</p>
  <p> Take any six 6-letter words that come to mind and write them in a column like so: MEMORY MASTER EASIER LIKELY ENDURE SIMPLE Memorize the 6-letter words you have written in the exact order that you have written them and remove the list from view.</p>
  <p> Now while visualizing your list, write the 1st letter of the 1st word, the 1st letter of the 2nd word and likewise on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th words.</p>
  <p> Then without stopping, write the 2nd letter of the 1st word, the 2nd letter of the 2nd word and likewise for the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th words.</p>
  <p> For instance, by choosing the above six words, the exercise would begin like this: MMELESEAAINI.</p>
  <p> Continue without stopping and go on to write all the 3rd letters of each word in order, the 4th letters, the 5th and finally all of the 6th letters of all 6 words in order.</p>
  <p> A line of letters on the above example would appear like this, if done correctly: MM E L E S E A A I N I M S S K D M O T I E U P R E E L R L Y R R Y E E 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 23 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 This is your first really complex drill, so take your time and devote 30 to 60 minutes per day practicing it.</p>
  <p> After each effort, double check your work for errors.</p>
  <p> Each time, work only from memory and don't look at previous efforts.</p>
  <p> Take six new 6-letter words each day and stick with it until you have completely mastered this technique of intermingling.</p>
