  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 128 </p><h1>3-Letter Word Calisthenics</h1>
  <p> You should proceed with this exercise only after mastering "<a href="MT/E127.html">Exercise 127 - Alphabet Gymnastics</a>."</p>
  <p> Your mind is beginning to see things in their entirety and not just from a singular angle.</p>
  <p> New brain circuits are being opened.</p>
  <p> Now write 30 three letter words on a sheet of paper and visualize them in your mind's eye while writing them (review "<a href="HS/E119.html">Exercise 119 - Mindfulness: Improving Your Conscious Awareness</a>").</p>
  <p> Next, remove the list and write your list from memory alone.</p>
  <p> Don't copy the list, but do this from memory.</p>
  <p> Write them as completely as you can and check each time to see how close you came.</p>
  <p> Now after mastering the list, write them all backwards in a continuous flowing rhythm.</p>
  <p> This allows your mind to break out of the rut of seeing words in only one way.</p>
  <p> Think of one of the 3-letter words you memorized and hold it in your mind.</p>
  <p> Print it backwards while spelling it forwards aloud.</p>
  <p> For example, write T - A - M and spell aloud M - A - T.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times, using a different 3-letter word each time.</p>
  <p> Now reverse the process and write a 3-letter word forward, while spelling the same word backwards.</p>
  <p> Practice 20 times with 20 different words.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 3-letter words and write one forwards, while spelling the other one forwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write D - O - G and spell aloud C - A - T.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times, using different 3-letter words each time.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 3-letter words and write one forwards, while spelling the other one backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write T - I - N and spell aloud K - A - O.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times, using different 3-letter words each time.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 3-letter words and write one backwards, while spelling the other one forwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write P - I - S and spell aloud L - A - P.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 3-letter words and write one backwards, while spelling the other one backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, write G - O - H and spell aloud D - N - E.</p>
  <p> Do this drill 20 times.</p>
  <p> Mastering these simplistic drills is only a prelude to other exercises to come later.</p>
  <p> A progressive building of your mental strength is intended, so do all the exercises as instructed.</p>
  <p> Take 30-60 minutes a day for this exercise or until you can do all the drills without hesitation.</p>
