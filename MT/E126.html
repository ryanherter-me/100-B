  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 126 </p><h1>Multi-Tracking On A Trampoline</h1>
  <p> Research has shown that learning the alphabet on a trampoline was easier for a child when each letter was recited at the bottom of the bounce.</p>
  <p> Besides the rhythm (see "<a href="SM/E083.html">Exercise 83 - Rhythmic Memorizing</a>"), the additional stimulation of a G-force on the memory cell was offered as an explanation.</p>
  <p> If you time your bounces to 60 per minute, it should enhance the effect.</p>
  <p> Using a mini-trampoline, certain multi-functioning abilities can be achieved with a regular rhythm.</p>
  <p> Using a blackboard or large poster board, create the following series of arrows: < < > > < > ^ < > < > ^ ^ < ^ < > ^ ^ > < < < ^ > < > ^ Now, while looking at the chart, begin bouncing on the mini-trampoline.</p>
  <p> Bring your concentrated attention to the direction of the arrows as you bounce up and down.</p>
  <p> At the bottom of each bounce and with your hands extended in front of you, move your hands up, down, left or right in the direction of each arrow as you move your eyes across each line of arrows from left to right.</p>
  <p> 'Attend' to each arrow with every bounce and move your hands in the appropriate direction without missing a bounce.</p>
  <p> If you skip a bounce or mess up in an arrow direction, start all over again.</p>
  <p> Continue with this until you can go through the whole series without error.</p>
  <p> Next, begin bouncing again, but this time, start in the lower right hand corner and work backwards from right to left, bottom line to top line.</p>
  <p> Again move your hands in the direction of the arrows as you bounce, and continue until you complete the whole series without any mistakes.</p>
  <p> Next, proceed with the arrows on the top line and go from left to right, throughout the whole series, but this time move your hands in the opposite direction of each arrow as you bounce.</p>
  <p> On each bounce, your hands respond in the reverse way that your mind perceives, but remember move your hands in each direction at the bottom of each bounce.</p>
  <p> Continue with this rhythm until the whole series is completed with- out error.</p>
  <p> Next, begin bouncing again, but this time start with the top line going from left to right and moving your hands in the same direction as the arrows.</p>
  <p> When you reach the second line, move your eyes from right to left and move your hands in the opposite direction of the arrows.</p>
  <p> When you reach the third line, move your eyes from left to right and move your hands in the same direction as the arrows.</p>
  <p> When your reach the fourth line, move your eyes from right to left and move your hands in the opposite direction of the arrows.</p>
  <p> Do this series without error and make each hand movement correspond to every bounce.</p>
  <p> Next, do one of the above drills while singing a tune, reciting the alphabet backwards or intermingled (see "<a href="MT/E127.html">Exercise 127 - Alphabet Gymnastics</a>"), or saying the 2's, 3's or 5's table while bouncing.</p>
  <p> To vary the drills even more, color half the arrows (with colored chalk on a blackboard or crayons on a poster board) intermittently green and half of them red.</p>
  <p> As you bounce and move your eyes across the lines, a green arrow means your hands go in the same direction as the arrow and a red arrow means your hands move in the opposite direction.</p>
  <p> Make up other combinations for yourself, but each time complete the series without error before moving on to another drill.</p>
  <p> Your mind/body coordination and concentration will be distinctly better at the completion of this exercise.</p>
