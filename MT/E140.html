  <p>MULTI-TASKING </p><p> Exercise 140 </p><h1>7 & 8-Letter Word Calisthenics</h1>
  <p> After mastering "<a href="MT/E139.html">Exercise 139 - Jumbled Sentences</a>," your mental level is at a new plateau.</p>
  <p> Begin this first drill by thinking of two 7-letter words.</p>
  <p> Write one forwards, and spell the other one backwards aloud.</p>
  <p> Now do the same with two 8-letter words.</p>
  <p> Do each drill with 20 different pairs of words.</p>
  <p> Now reverse the procedure and do the same thing, but write one backwards and spell the other forwards.</p>
  <p> Do these drills with 20 different pairs of words as well.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 7-letter words and write one backwards, while spelling the other one backwards.</p>
  <p> Now do the same thing with two 8-letter words.</p>
  <p> Do each drill 20 times with different words.</p>
  <p> Now think of two 7-letter words and intermingle one forwards and the other backwards.</p>
  <p> For example, C - O - D - D - L - E - D and S - T - R - A - N - G - E become CEOGDNDALRETDS or SDTERLADNDGOEC.</p>
  <p> Now do the same thing with two 8-letter words.</p>
  <p> Do each drill with 20 different pairs of words.</p>
  <p> Next, think of two 7-letter words and intermingle both of them backwards.</p>
  <p> Now do the same thing with two 8-letter words.</p>
  <p> Do each drill with 20 different pairs of words.</p>
  <p> Do all these drills 30-60 minutes each day or until you have completely mastered them.</p>
  <p> Now you are capable of reading the problems of a test paper straight through and inserting the answers as your multi-faceted mind achieves each answer -- and all while you simultaneously are internally working on all the questions simultaneously!</p>
